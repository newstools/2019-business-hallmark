The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has said it is shocked at the ruling of the Supreme Court on the contentious Osun State Governorship election. The apex court had earlier on Friday, upheld the victory of Osun State governor, Gboyega Oyetola of the All Progressive Congress (APC) and dismissed the suit filed by the PDP candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke. However, the opposition party in a statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondinyan, said the judgement was shocking, pointing out that the fact that the Supreme Court had a split judgment also speaks volumes on its verdict in this matter. “Our study of the judgment however shows that the Supreme Court did not negate the position of the PDP and millions of Nigerians that our candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke won the election, but based its verdict on reservations over issues of technicalities arising at the election petition tribunal,” the party said. “Nevertheless, our party stands with overwhelming majority of Nigerians on that undeniable fact that the people of Osun State, by the votes cast at the poll, preferred Senator Adeleke as their governor. “The PDP, as a law-abiding party, however, urges the people of Osun state to remain united, calm and not lose hope in our democratic process and the quest for a government that truly represents their wishes and aspirations.” Senator Adeleke had meanwhile, accepted the verdict and wished Mr. Oyetola well.
