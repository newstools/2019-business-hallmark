The Nigerian Institute of Training and Development has called for the integration of technology in the training of professional manpower with a view to enhancing human capital development. The Chairman, 2019 Annual Trainers’ Conference of NITAD, Felix Ajalogun, who made the call at a press briefing in Lagos, said that the corporate world was going digital to promote effectiveness and efficiency. A statement quoted Ajalogun as saying, “Digital transformation is the profound transformation of business and organisational activities, processes, competencies and models to fully leverage the changes and opportunities of a mix of digital technologies and their accelerating impact on learning and development in a strategic and prioritised way, with present  and future.” He added, “We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we learn, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything human kind has experienced before. “We do not yet know just how it will unfold, but one thing is clear: the response to it must be integrated and comprehensive, involving all stakeholders of the global learning, training and development professionals, from the public and private sectors to (the) academia.”
