The Department of State Services (DSS) has invited founder of the Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), Ralph Uwazurike over a video message he released on Tuesday calling on the Igbo to resist Federal Government’s proposed Ruga settlements for Fulani herdsmen. Uwazurike, who now leads the Biafra Independent Movement (BIM) had in the video, criticised the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dr. Nina Nwodo over his reponse to a threat by the Northern Coalition Group, saying that the Ohanaeze leader ought not be the one to reply the coalition since they did not deserve his response, while faulting World Igbo Congress’ position and statements on RUGA and state of the nation. The Coalition of Northern Groups had in a press conference addressed by its spokesperson, Adul Aziz Suleiman, on Wednesday last week, threatened to take action against Southerners living in the North if Southern governors did not accept Ruga within 30 days. The group also gave the President Muhammadu Buhari led Federal Government a 30-day ultimatum to reverse its suspension of Ruga. In response, Uwazurike asked the Igbo worldwide to reject RUGA, while calling for a meeting of all Igbo people to help organise a formidable resistance to the proposed settlement in any part of Igbo land. He argued that division, not restructuring, remained the solution to the country’s challenges, while recalling that the late Biafra leader, Chukwuemeka Ojukwu had advised him, following his renewed struggle for Biafra, not to do anything that will force the Igbo into another civil war. The DSS in an SMS to Uwazurike on Wednesday said: “I’m Samson from DSS office Imo state Headquarters Owerri. You are invited to come to DSS Imo state headquarters Owerri tomorrow 11/07/2019 for a meeting with the State Director. Time 1200 hours.
