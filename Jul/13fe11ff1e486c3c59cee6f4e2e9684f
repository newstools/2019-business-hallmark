…her death unacceptable – Akeredolu, Ondo governor Daughter of Pa Reuben Fasoranti, leader of Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, Funke Olakunrin was shot dead by gunmen suspected to be herdsmen along Benin Ore Expressway on Friday. Afenifere spokesperson, Yinka Odumakin who issued a statement confirming the killing of the 58-year-old Funke, said she was coming from Akure, the Ondo State capital when the suspected herdsmen struck. “We have confirmed the death of Mrs Funke Olakunrin (58), daughter of our Leader, Chief Fasoranti, Odumakin said. “Eyewitness accounts say she died of gunshot from Fulani herdsmen who shot her at Ore junction in Ondo state earlier today. “She was coming from Akure when the armed Fulani herdsmen came from the bush to attack her and other vehicles. Her domestic staff in the car with her sustained gunshots too. This is one death too many and a clear we- can- take- it -no-more death.” Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo state, has described the killing as unacceptable. In a statement issued on his behalf by Donald Ojogo, Ondo commissioner for information, the governor said it was a dastardly act that has again heightened the level of fear that has pervaded the country. “This sad development once again, heightens the level of fear that has pervaded our nation, even as it represents a despicable commentary in all ramifications,” he said. “To say the least, it represents an unenviable turning point, the depth of everything that is evil. On behalf of the state executive council, the governor symphatises with our foremost leader and indeed the people of the state over this dastardly act. “However, the governor wishes to appeal to all and sundry to remain calm and allow the Police to unravel the perpetrators of this murder. Already, the commissioner of police has been directed to comb all forests of Ondo state to bring to book, these bloodthirsty murderers. There is no hiding place for such in Ondo state.”
