While it has been widely reported that the President Muhammadu Buhari government has suspended the controversial Ruga settlements for Fulani herdsmen across the country, a memo allegedly sent from the office of the Chief of Staff to the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to that effect and seen by BusinessHallmark, shows that the president only directed that the implementation goes through the ‘right processes.’ The memo which has not been disowned by the government, specifically noted that the, “Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development will be inaugurated in due course to oversee the Delivery of the project.” The said memo reads: The Ruga Model Settlement Project: Mr President has directed the immediate suspension of the current unilateral implementation of the Ruga Model Settlement Programme by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development as it is not in accordance with the designs approved by:
a) the National Economic Council, NEC; 
b) the National Food Security Council, NFSC; 
c) the Federal Executive Council FEC An Implementation Committee of the National Livestock Transformation Programme comprising of representatives from NEC, NFSC and the Hon. Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development will be inaugurated in due course to oversee the Delivery of the project. Please accept the assurance of my highest esteem. Abba Kyari
