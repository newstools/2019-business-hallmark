The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has weighed in on the ongoing controversy over Ruga settlements for Fulani herdsmen, calling on all Nigerians to refrain from actions that tend to overheat the polity. The ACF stated this in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Muhammad Ibrahim-Biu in Kaduna on Saturday. The apex Northern sociopolitical group said it shared the concern of the Coalition of Northern Groups, who gave the Federal Government 30-day ultimatum to reverse its decision on Ruga and threatened Southerners living in the region. ACF noted that the Federal Government put on hold the Ruga settlements because it was inconsistent with the National Livestock Transformation Plan, even as it reminded that Ruga remained voluntary for states. “The Federal Government has put on hold the Ruga Settlement program, that it was inconsistent with the National Livestock Transformation Plan approved by the National Economic Council,” the group said. “Moreover, the program was designed as a voluntary (project) for willing state governments. Arewa Consultative Forum, therefore, urges all concerned to exercise restraint in taking actions that may be inimical to peace and stability in our polity. “ACF also shares the concern of the Coalition of the Northern Groups on the plight of genuine herdsmen in pursuit of their livelihood in some parts of the country.” It called on the Federal Government to “institute measures that would ameliorate the suffering of not only herders but all those involved in the value chain of livestock production.”
