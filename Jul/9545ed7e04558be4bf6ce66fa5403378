The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it wants to restore the confidence of voters in the governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states. Speaking during his appearance on Channels Television’s Politics Today, Mr Festus Okoye that the Commission was working hard to conduct credible elections in both states on November 16. “Based on what we are hearing from the stakeholders, we are going to move into Bayelsa and Kogi states early enough to build the confidence of the voters and the confidence of the stakeholders,” Okoye who is the INEC Chairman of Information and Voter Education Committee said on Monday. He added, “So we are going to move in on time and hold meetings with the religious leaders, civil society groups and organisations, political parties, security agencies with all the critical stakeholders. The INEC official explained that they intend to carry out ‘a robust’ voter education to ensure the people of the states understand their processes and procedures. According to him, the electoral umpire will build the confidence of the people and make them understand that it is ready to conduct an election they will be proud of. Okoye, who is also INEC National Commissioner, urged political parties conduct their primaries in line with the provisions of the Electoral Act. He stressed that Sections 87 and 31 of the Act already explained how political parties should field candidates that would fly their flags in the governorship elections. When asked if INEC has enough time to implement the report by electoral observers in the general elections, Okoye gave assurance that the Commission would consider it. “The ones that we can do administratively, we will carry them out; the ones that need legislative intervention, if a new law comes into being before then, we will implement them,” he said.
