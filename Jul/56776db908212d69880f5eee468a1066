After months of back and forth, Nigeria has finally agreed to sign the Africa free-trade deal at an extraordinary summit of the African Union this weekend in Niger Republic, bringing the duty-free movement of goods in the region a step closer. The presidency confirmed the decision in a twitter post, saying that the country will sign the deal at the summit in Niger “after extensive domestic consultations, and is focused on taking advantage of ongoing negotiations to secure the necessary safeguards against smuggling, dumping and other risks or threats.” While the African Continental Free Trade Area came into force on paper in May, Nigeria is one of 29 countries yet to sign the agreement. Amb. Albert Muchanga, the Commissioner for Trade and Industry African Union Commission also confirmed Nigeria’s decision to sign on to the agreement. “Officially confirmed! #Nigeria to sign the #AfCFTA Agreement during Niger Extra-Ordinary Summit in few days. Good and important development. Two more to go and an All Africa Market will start shaping up,” he wrote on twitter. President Muhammadu Buhari last week received a report urging him to sign the deal from a committee that was set up to consider whether the country should join.
