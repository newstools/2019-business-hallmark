Singer R. Kelly was arrested Thursday night on federal sex-crime charges, according to a spokesman for the local U.S. attorneyâ€™s office, AP reports. Joseph Fitzpatrick, the spokesman, said the 13-count indictment includes charges of child pornography, enticement of a minor and obstruction of justice. He said further details would be released Friday. Mr. Fitzpatrick said Mr. Kelly was taken into custody at about 7 p.m. local time and was being held by federal authorities. The 52-year-old R&B singer, whose real name is Robert Kelly, is already facing state sex-related charges in Illinois involving four women, three of whom were minors when the alleged abuse occurred. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and was released on bail.
