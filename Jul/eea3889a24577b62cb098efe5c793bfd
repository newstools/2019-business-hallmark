…says religion has failed Africa Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, has lamented that region was tearing the country apart, noting that country would continue to perform below expectations if its leaders continued to mismanage its plurality Bishop Kukah said this on Monday while delivering keynote addresse at the 9th Toyin Falola Annual International Conference held at Babcock University, Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State with the theme: ‘Religion, the State and Global Politics.’ “We are carrying Western identity, whether it is Christianity or Islam. This identity has continued to play out in our daily lives,” he said. “Only in Nigeria we can go to war because of religion. We are not going to go to war because of no water; we are not going to go to war because we don’t have roads. “We are not going to go to war because we don’t have decent housing; we are not going to go to war because of a lack of salary; we are not going to go to war because of injustice; but we can go to war in the name of God.” Kukah pointed out that the problem is not peculiar to Nigeria, however, as according to him, religion has failed the continent of Africa as most countries with substantial Muslims and Christians population have not known peace. “Nigeria seems to be like a polygamist, who is married with two wives. Somehow, Christians are complaining that they are treating Muslims better, Muslims are complaining that they are treating Christians better,” said. “But nobody is complaining whether religion is getting its due. But my argument is that unless religion through some of us who are leaders and practitioners find itself rescued from the clutches of politics and politicians, the wrong notion will continue as it is in Nigeria. Somehow, religion will be a problem.”
