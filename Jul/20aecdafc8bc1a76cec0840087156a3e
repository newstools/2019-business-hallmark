…says don’t blame us when we fight back The Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land and leader of Oodua People’s Congress, Gani Adams, has reacted to the killing of Mrs. Funke Olakunrin, daughter of Afenifere leader, Pa Reuben Fasoranti by suspected Fulani herdsmen on Friday, describing it as an invasion of the peaceful atmosphere of the South West. Adams who said this in statement by his media aide, warned that Yoruba ethnic group should not be blamed if it decides to react to the killings in the region. He noted that the Yoruba was not short of ideas needed to put an end to atrocities in the region. “We only want the whole world to know what has been done and being done to our people. They should be aware of the actions that preceded our reaction when it eventually comes,” Adams said. “We are not bereft of ideas of how to stop this criminality on our land. It is just so that we should not be blamed when the reaction comes. “We are like the proverbial goat that it being chased. When it gets to the wall, it will certainly react. We are at that stage now.” Consoling the bereaved elder Fasoranti, he said “Papa, this is a very trying time, but it is certain justice will come.”
