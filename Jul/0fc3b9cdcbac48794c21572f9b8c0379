President Muhammadu Buhari has sought the confirmation of the Senate for the appointment of Professor Habu Galadima as the substantive Director General of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos. The President of the Senate, Dr Ahmed Lawan read the letter from the President to his colleagues at the plenary on Tuesday. Buhari said his correspondence dated July 9, was backed by Section 8 (5) of the NIPSS Act, which empowers him to forward the name of nominees for the office to Senate for confirmation. He appealed to the lawmakers to give necessary support that would ensure smooth screening and confirmation of Galadima. The President noted that he attached a copy of the nominee’s curriculum vitae to the letter to further enable the Senate to have more information about him. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Galadima was born in 1963 at Toto Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. In a similar letter read by the President of the Senate, Buhari also requested the Senate to confirm the appointment of Mr Uba Maska as Executive Director of the National Communication Commission. The letter quoted Section 8 (1) of the NCC Act as empowering the President to seek the Senate confirmation.
