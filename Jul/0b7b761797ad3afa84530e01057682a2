 The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has said it will take disciplinary measures against Senator Elisha Abbo, one of its senators caught on CCTV camera molesting a pregnant woman in a shop in Abuja recently. The party said in a post on its twitter handle, @OfficialPDPNig on Wednesday, that although the senator’s action was a personal character failure, it would not allow such within its ranks. “The attention of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP has been drawn to a CCTV footage relating to allegations of malfeasance by a senator elected on the platform of the PDP, Senator Elisha Abbo,” the party said. “The PDP, as a law-abiding and upstanding party, detests and completely condemn such act of lawlessness and callousness as exhibited in the video and will therefore never condone it. “Our party is also shocked that the harmless victim of the unprovoked assault is said to be a nursing mother, who ought to be protected. “Though this is a personal conduct of an individual which has no bearing with the culture of our party, the PDP however holds that no responsible person will condone such an attitude. “In the light of this, the NWC has commenced investigation into the matter and summons Senator Elisha Abbo in line with the provisions of the Constitution of the PDP and code of conduct of our members. In the same vein, the party has taken note of the immediate action taken by the PDP, at all levels of engagement, is reputed for her utmost respect and commitment towards the rights, safety and wellbeing of our citizens, particularly our women and cannot tolerate any callous assault on any Nigerian. “The PDP therefore assures Nigerians that it will always stand on the side of justice and will never spare a thought in taking action on any of its members found wanting, particularly those elected or appointed into public offices.”
