Adamawa State Police Command has confirmed the killing of Senator Elisha Abbo’s uncle and the abduction of his stepmother. The command Spokesman, DSP Suleiman Yahaya, confirmed the incident to News Agency of Nigeria in Yola on Saturday. Yahaya said the incident occurred on Saturday around 3:00 a.m. at the family house of Abbo in Muchalla Village of Mubi North Local Government Area. Yahaya explained that the gunmen had abducted Abbo’s stepmother identified as Rifkatu when Abbo’s uncle came out of his house nearby and raised an alarm. He was immediately shot to death by the fleeing gunmen. The command’s spokesman said the identity of Abbo’s uncle would be released later. “Our men from the Inspector General of Police team are after them,” Yahaya said. He also commented on Wednesday’s kidnapping of the Permanent Secretary of Adamawa Ministry of Mineral Resources, Mr Emmanuel Piridimso, saying he was released on Friday. “The kidnappers realized that we were closing up on them and have since released the man; he was released on Friday,” Yahaya said. He called on members of the public to support the police and other security agencies to effectively tackle crime in the state. (NAN)
