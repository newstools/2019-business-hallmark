…rejects offer of automatic ticket for 2022 gov poll The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in the 2018 Osun State governorship candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, was coerced to contest in the September 2018 election, his brother Deji Adeleke, has said.
“Senator Ademola Nurudeen Adeleke had no intention to contest the Governorship Election in the first place,” his brother, Deji Adeleke, said in a statement.
Deji said the PDP candidate “was invited and prevailed upon by the party leadership and party elders to contest” for the September 2018 election.
“He and his family accepted most reluctantly after receiving assurances and promises that were never kept.”
The billionaire businessman was reacting to the automatic ticket the PDP is offering Ademola to re-contest the 2022 governorship poll after he lost the election petition to the All Progressives Congress (APC) rival Gboyega Oyetola at the Supreme Court.
He rejected the automatic ticket for his brother stating that Ademola deserves to be “given a break”.
He further urged the party to administer a “transparent primary elections” for all elective positions, including the ticket for the “position of governor of the state.”
A spokesman for Senator Adeleke, Rasheed Olawale, confirmed to newsmen that statement originated from the elder Adeleke.
