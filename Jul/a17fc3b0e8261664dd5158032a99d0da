The People’s Democratic Party has suspended Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, Hon. Wole Oke, Hon. Lynda Ikpeazu, Hon. Anayo Edwin, Hon. Gideon Gwadi, Hon. Toby Okechukwu and Hon. Adekoya Abdul-Majid for anti party activity over their role in the House of Representatives leadership, particularly as it concerns the house minority leader. The party which took the decision after its National Working Committee (NWC) meeting on Friday, said it was in line with its constitution. “The National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP met today, the 5th of July 2019 and reviewed issues surrounding the Minority Leadership of the House of Representatives,” a statement by Kola Ologbondiyan, the party’s spokesperson said. “The Party noted the roles played by the under-listed members which resulted in the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon.

Lynda Ikpeazu, Hon. Anayo Edwin, Hon. Gideon Gwadi, Hon. Toby Okechukwu and Hon. Adekoya Abdul-Majid. “After preliminary examination by the NWC, it was evident that the roles played by the above mentioned members, bordered on indiscipline, insubordination and disobedience of party directives contrary to Section 58 (1)(b)(c)(f)(h) of the PDP Constitution (as amended in 2017), which provides that: “Subject to the provision of this Constitution, the Party shall have power to discipline any member who says or does anything likely to bring the party into disrepute, hatred or contempt; disobeys or neglects to carry out lawful directives of the party or any organ or officer of the party; engages in anti-party activities; or engages in any conduct likely to cause disaffection among members of the party or is likely to disrupt the peaceful, lawful and efficient conduct of the business of the party”. “Consequent upon this, the above mentioned members of our party are hereby suspended for one month and this matter is hereby referred to the National Disciplinary Committee of our party, in keeping with Section 57(3) of the PDP Constitution.”
