Saraki further commended the efforts of the committee; as well as the patience of the Nigerian workers and the leadership of the Labour Union who has over the years, been calling for the minimum wage and have carried their efforts responsibly.
He expressed the hope that with the minimum wage, Nigerian workers will double their efforts to increase their productivity, ‘so that we can also improve the general productivity of the country.’
“It is my hope that the implementation of this bill will start immediately,” the Senate President added.
The National Assembly’s approval is a sequel to the protest and industrial action held by the NLC over the previous minimum wage of N18,000. © 2019, Hallmarknews. All rights reserved. Reference and link to this site is required if you wish to reuse any article. comments and opinions
