A former Governor of Ogun State, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, backtracked on his move join the All Progressives Congress (APC), saying he has not joined the ruling party.
Daniel had earlier announced his exit from partisan politics.
There were earlier reports that he had joined the APC, but he has said he is yet to agree to “pressure” from his supporters to join. “I have not agreed. Whereas my people are free to move, I am yet to decide finally if I want to reenter partisan politics having just quit.
“The meeting agreed that my resignation from the PDP was in order. The meeting vehemently disagreed with my decision to quit partisan politics.
“The meeting raised a motion that I should lead them into APC which motion was unanimously adopted.
“I earlier on in my speech said that I have freed them and they can choose to stay in the PDP or join APC or any other party of their choice since I have decided to be non partisan to which they all responded that APC is their choice having worked for Dapo Abiodun on my instruction.
“Mrs Apampa in her closing speech then propounded the Duck Theory literally meaning that they will move ahead to APC and will drag me along behind them. I made no further comments and the meeting ended.” © 2019, Hallmarknews. All rights reserved. Reference and link to this site is required if you wish to reuse any article. comments and opinions
