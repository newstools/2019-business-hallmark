She made this statement on Tuesday which was International Day of Persons with Disabilities at the Inclusion Hub, Surulere Lagos. Speaking at the event, she said, “I am pleased to be here today to join Project Enable in observing the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. “The goal is to promote a greater understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights and well-being of persons with disabilities. This is important because working towards an accessible future for everyone is everyone’s responsibility. “From our founding, the United States has recognized that equality for all is fundamental to democracy. “One of the ways the United States promotes the full integration of the disabled is by encouraging and assisting civil society organizations around the world.” Pierangelo hailed Sola Owoniko founder of Project Enable Africa for the remarkable work he has been doing. She said, “We are proud to support Sola Owonikoko and Project Enable in their promotion of opportunities for people living with disabilities.” Sola started Project Enable in 2014 as a member of the Carrington Youth Fellowship, an initiative of U.S. Consulate General Lagos.
