The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the election of Mallam Nasir El-Rufai as Governor of Kaduna State.
The apex court also upheld the election of Nasarawa Governor Abdullahi Sule. It dismissed the appeal of David Ombugadu and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against the March 9, 2019 victory of Sule. The seven-man panel led by Justice Mary Peter-Odili said the appeal lacked merit.
