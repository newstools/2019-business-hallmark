Millions of Nigerians without Tax Identification may be denied access to their bank accounts from January 2020 following the passage of the Finance Bill, as amended, by the National Assembly. The assembly had amended sections 33, 49 & 58 of the Personal Income Tax Act, making it mandatory for individuals to produce their Tax Identification Numbers (TIN) before they can operate existing or new bank accounts in Nigeria. The implication of the amendment is that those without will not be able to operate their bank accounts. Individuals without the TIN are however, advised to obtain same before January 2, 2020, which according to the countryâ€™s finance minister, Zainab Ahmed, is the date the implementation of the policy will commence. Individuals can verify whether they have TIN or not by visiting the Joint Tax Board website. https://tinverification.jtb.gov.ng Or Federal Inland Revenue Website https://apps.firs.gov.ng/tinverification/
