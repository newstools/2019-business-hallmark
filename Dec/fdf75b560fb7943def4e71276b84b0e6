“We are expecting 120,000 beneficiaries all over Nigeria but from what I have seen, we may surpass the number and we are ready for them because we have the materials and we also have many Non-governmental organizations (NGO’s), pharmaceutical companies, hospitals among others that are supporting us,” he said.
As usual, beneficiaries were not only screened to know their health status on malaria, diabetes, cancer among others but parted with drugs as first aid to nib in the bud to every early threat to their health.
The President-elect, Rotarian Chandra Nalode, who expressed happiness and satisfaction at the turn out of beneficiaries disclosed that the club was known for laudable and sustainable projects, aside from the free health camps which include cataract surgeries, giving out of artificial limbs among others, adding that the club created an awareness of the event in the vicinity which informed the enormous crowd that came for screening.
Rotary Club of Lagos Palmgrove Estate targeted 1,000 beneficiaries during this event, at which some of the beneficiaries spoke with newsmen, stating the ailment that brought them and the health attention given.
“This is my second time attending this event, the first one was last year, March 2nd where I had an operation on my left eye for free, and it became better. But today I’m here for my right eye which just recently started giving me pains,” Halja Abimbolam Thompson said.
Another beneficiary was little Miss Adeyemi Opeyemi, who complained of her inabilities to read properly as a result of poor sight was amply attended to.
However, one of the health practitioners present, Dr. (Mrs.) Zainab Sulaimom, stated that hypertension is the mostly prevalent among patients between the ages of 40-years and above and detected to be a result of over thinking. Most of the children who attended were diagnosed with malaria.
Other prevailing illnesses outlined by Dr. Sulaimon were body pain, chest pain and vaginal infections.
