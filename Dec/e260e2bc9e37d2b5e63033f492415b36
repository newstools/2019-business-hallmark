Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari, Mr Femi Adesina has dismissed the notion that Nigerians are unhappy about Omoyele Sowore’s re-arrest. He made this known on Monday on Channels Television’s breakfast programme, Sunrise Daily. In a telephone chat with one of the presenters, Adesina was asked what he would tell Nigerians who are not happy with the way agents of the Department of State Services rearrested Sowore. He replied by saying “It is a lie that many Nigerians are unhappy about Sowore’s predicament. It is only a few people who are making noise. It is the work of a vocal minority.” He further stated that “This is a country of millions of people. A few people talking does not mean it is all Nigerians.” Nigerian activist and journalist Omoyele Sowore was dramatically re-arrested Friday just hours after being freed on bail, in a case that has raised questions over free speech in the country. Sowore, who is the publisher of US-based Sahara Reporters newsite and ran for president in February’s general elections, was detained after calling for a nationwide demonstration against President Muhammadu Buhari. He was charged with treason, money laundering and cyberstalking the President, charges he has denied.
