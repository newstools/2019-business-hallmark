According to a police source, a policeman and a commercial motorcyclist met their untimely death during the attack.
Business Hallmark learnt that the youths stormed the church after the corpse of a one- year- old boy declared missing in the church some weeks ago was reportedly exhumed.
The policeman, it was gathered, was killed by the mob at the scene of the incident while the motorcyclist was allegedly shot dead by a stray bullet.
Sources disclosed that the one-year-old boy had gone missing boy during a church service in November. The little boy, Gold Kolawole, was kidnapped in the church and his whereabouts were unknown until Wednesday when it was alleged that his corpse was found and exhumed by security men.
However, another account stated that the residents of the area got angry when some pastors of the church started morning service on Wednesday. They attacked the church and one of the policemen manning the place was mobbed.
“The unlucky policeman was killed by the mob because the police failed to conduct a proper investigation on the matter”, a witness said.
Meanwhile, the pastor of the church, Prophet Alfa Babatunde, has been taken into protective custody by the Department of State Security (DSS)
