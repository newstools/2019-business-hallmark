The Nigerian Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr.Isa Pantami  has urged the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to strike a balance between the consumers and operators saying that the telecom operators stand to make more profit when price of data is low.
The Minister, stated this when he received the management team of the NCC, led by its Executive Vice Chairman ,Prof Umar Danbatta at the Ministry’s in  Abuja.
The NCC team was at the ministry to make a presentation to the Minister on new data packages been offered by some telecom operators and efforts made to review the price of mobile data downwards.
Pantimi commended the telecom operators that have introduced new data packages recently but maintained that the price of mobile data in Nigeria is still not encouraging and on the high side, considering the cost of living in Nigeria and the over 170 Million internet users in the country.
He  noted  that ,he was aware of the challenges  faced by the telecom operators stressing that it wasn’t  enough reason to justify the high cost of mobile data in Nigeria as other countries facing similar or more challenges have a lower mobile data price.
“The way we encourage and urge the regulator to put eyes on the operators is the same way we challenge our government to make the environment very enabling for the operators”.
Adding that, some Nigerians have been agitating for communications tax.
“…so far, I am among the people that are resisting, as I am not convinced it is in the best interest of the sector,” the minister said
