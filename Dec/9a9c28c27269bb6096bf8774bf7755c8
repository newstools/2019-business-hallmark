Access Bank on Thursday emerged best bank in Nigeria at The Banker awards which held at the Sheraton Grand Park Lane, London. The Banker’s twentieth annual Bank of the Year awards was presented at a dinner held on November 28th at the Sheraton Grand London Park Lane. The event provides an unrivalled opportunity to meet and network with industry peers and to celebrate the achievements of successful financial institutions from around the world. Entrants were asked to provide comprehensive data on their earnings, asset and Tier 1 capital growth, and returns on equity. But good figures, while essential, were not enough. The editorial team looked for evidence of banks setting new standards for their local industries, whether it was by using new technology or coming up with innovative, cost-efficient ways of expanding their businesses. Head, Media Relations, Access Bank, Abdul Imoyo in chat with Business Hallmark said “the bank is being recognized for its achievements and contribution to economic growth.” Access Bank plc, commonly known as Access Bank, is a Nigerian multinational commercial bank, owned by Access Bank Group.
