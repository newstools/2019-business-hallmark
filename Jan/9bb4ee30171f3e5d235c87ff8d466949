Speaking on the losers’, Omordion said over 69 stocks were on the year’s worst performing table dominated by insurance stocks due to NSE’s new pricing rule.
Omordion attributed the loss recorded by Lafarge Africa to weak earnings and the inability of the company to declare dividend to investors for some years now.
