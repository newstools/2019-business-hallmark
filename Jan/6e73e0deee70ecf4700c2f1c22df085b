Egypt forward Salah, 26, beat Liverpool team-mate Sadio Mane of Senegal and Arsenal and Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to the title. He received the award at a ceremony in Senegal on Tuesday. “I have dreamt of winning this award since I was a child and now I have done so twice in a row,” Salah said. Houston Dash and South Africa forward Thembi Kgatlana was named Women’s Player of the Year. Salah was voted the BBC African Footballer of the Year for the second time in December.
