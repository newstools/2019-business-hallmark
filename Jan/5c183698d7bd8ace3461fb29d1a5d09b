The Federal Government has borrowed about N6.16 trillion out of the N8.49 trillion pension assets under the Contributory Pension Scheme. These figures were released by the National Pension Commission (NPC) on Tuesday in Abuja, revealing the FG’s borrowing represents 73.5 percent of the pension fund. According to data from Pencom, Pension Fund Administrators also invested 6.87 per cent or N584.321bn of the fund in domestic ordinary shares, while 0.71 or N60.529bn of the fund was invested in foreign ordinary shares. The commission, which said that it continued its consultative philosophy in the regulation and supervision of the industry, said the risk-based examination approach was implemented as a way of promoting transparency and providing early warning signals as well as encouraging pension operators to regularly self-evaluate their positions.
