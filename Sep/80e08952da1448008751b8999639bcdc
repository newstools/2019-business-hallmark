Governor of Jigawa State, Dr Muhammad Badaru Abubakar, has noted that crude oil, which is currently the mainstay of Nigeria’s economy, will be a worthless commodity in the next 15 years. The governor who said this at an Agricultural Retreat in Damaturu, Yobe State, noted that the country needed to quickly diversify from the oil economy if it were to survive, as according to him, technological advancements across the globe will soon render oil worthless. He said it was unfortunate that despite the agricultural potential the country has, it has continued to depend on crude oil. The governor praised President Muhammadu Buhari for promoting agriculture, emphasising that the president’s ‘Mu koma gona’ (people should go back to farm) vision is a good initiative that would create jobs and boost the country’s economy.
