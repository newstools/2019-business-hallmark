About 185 Nigerians on Wednesday night, arrived the International Wing of the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos from South Africa aboard Air Peace. Their arrival followed a wave of xenophobic violence in the South African country. This was, however, against the 320 Nigerians expected back home as a number of others were prevented from travelling by the South African government. The flight arrived the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos at 9:43 pm.
