Kaduna State Chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has commended the state governor, Nasir El-Rufai’s decision to save the 110-year-old St. George Anglican Church, Zaria from demolition. This followed the clarification on Friday, by the Director General of the Kaduna State Urban Planning Development Agency, Ismail Dikko that the Church won’t be touched because of its historical value. The agency had served the church with a seven-day quit notice which it claimed was a directive from Governor El-Rufai. However, following an alarm on Thursday by CAN, the KASUPDA DG reversed the eviction order on the Church, a development that has drawn praises from the state Chairman of CAN, Rev. Joseph Hayab. Hayab in a telephone interview with the Punch, commended the state government for listening to the yearnings of the people by reversing its earlier decision. “We commend the government for this act. What we are saying is that government should remain a listening government. Democracy thrives when government listen to the people but when government don’t listen to people, people think negatively about every action it takes,” he said. “What we are doing is simply to remind government that we are not at war with them. We are just raising alarm; we are just another added eyes for them to see and know what is happening to people.”
