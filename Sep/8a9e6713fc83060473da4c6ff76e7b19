AG. Leventis (Nigeria) Plc is wrapping plans to delist from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) as a follow up to Boval S. A’s intention to acquire the shares held by other shareholders of the Company at an offer price of 53 kobo per share.
In a release signed by Ms. Bola Adebisi, AG. Leventis’ (Nigeria) Company Secretary/Legal Adviser, which was sent to the NSE on Tuesday, the company informed the Exchange that Boval S. A was acting on behalf of itself, Leventis Holding S.A., and Leventis Overseas Limited, which are together the company’s core shareholders, has already approached the Board of Directors of the Company with an intention and subsequently delist the Company from the Nigerian Stock Exchange.
“The offer price of 53 kobo represents a premium of 85 per cent to the 60-day volume weighted average share price and 104 per cent to the Company’s closing share price on 23 September 2019,” it stated.
The Proposed Transaction will be implemented under a Scheme of Arrangement in line with section 539 of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap C.20 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.
The Proposed Transaction is still subject to the review and clearance of The Nigerian Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the approval of the shareholders of the Company. The company said the terms and conditions of the Proposed Transaction will be provided in the Scheme Document, which will be dispatched to all shareholders following the receipt of the “no-objection” of the regulators and an order from the Federal Hiqh Court to convene a Court-Ordered Meeting.
