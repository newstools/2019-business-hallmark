A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, Tuesday, has granted Omoyele Sowore, Sahara Reporters Publisher and convener of #RevolutionNow protest, bail. The court released him to the custody of Femi Falana, his counsel, and asked that he deposit his international passport with the court registry within 48 hours. While delivering a ruling on Tuesday, Taiwo Taiwo, the judge, said there was no longer a subsisting order holding him in detention. “The order of court has expired. It has not been renewed and cannot be renewed in view of the motion ex-parte earlier withdrawn,” Justice Taiwo said. “The liberty of all Nigerians high or low, poor or rich is guaranteed by the constitution. It’s for this end that I’m of the view that the defendant ought to be released forthwith.” The court said it  took the decision after being informed that Mr Sowore’s investigation had been concluded.
