The General Overseers of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (Worldwide), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has urged Nigerians not to retaliate against South Africans and their businesses over ongoing xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in their country. Beginning his sermon at about 11pm at the September edition of the monthly Holy Ghost Service, held at the Redemption Camp along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Adeboye said, “I beg you in the name of God, don’t retaliate against South Africa.” The revered pastor recalled his frightening experience as a student of the University of Nigeria Nsukka as the Civil War was about to start, when non-easterners were seized in tbe Eastern Region as students of the University of Ibadan were also seized in the Western Region. Adeboye noted that only a few South Africans were fomenting trouble, stating an average citizen of the country is decent. He also noted that Nigerians relocate to countries like South Africa in search of jobs that were not available in their country. He, therefore, warned Nigerians against reprisal attacks for the sake of their countrymen who are still in South Africa. The pastor said in parts, “Be careful. Don’t retaliate against South Africa, because of the Nigerians who are still in South Africa. “So, for the sake of your own kit and kin, don’t retaliate against South Africa. Let us leave this job to the governments, let them solve this problem at the governmental level. Pray for them, that God will give them the wisdom, the understanding, the ability to do it.”
