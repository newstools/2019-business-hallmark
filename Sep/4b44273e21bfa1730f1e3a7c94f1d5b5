He told Business Hallmark what the seminar aims to achieve in a brief interview. According to Raymond Toyo, stress is one of the major reasons many people fall ill is because of stress. He stated that there is a need to awareness on the need for people to get proper rest. He said, “We realized that the major health problems we have in this country are stress related. And many people don’t know the extent of what stress causes to the health, what damage stress can do to the health. They are not aware of that. You see people wake up around 4am and leave the house around 5am. They may not get back till 11pm. Hours in the traffic, mental stress, emotional stress, physical stress, people really don’t know what that would cause in the body. “We need to sanitize the people about the danger of stress and what it can cause in the body and how to manage the stress and whatever dis-ease that would emanate from stress, so that we have a better society. “There are so many people that what they need to do sometimes is just to relax. A lot of people don’t know the importance of sleep because they want to make money. They don’t know they have to sleep for a number of hours. “I have this patience that says ‘if I can sleep for three hours.’ How can you sleep for only three hours in 24 hours and expect to be fine? You can’t be fine.”
