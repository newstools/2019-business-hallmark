Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms Hadiza Bala Usman, has said that the reasons vessels avoid using Eastern ports is due to the level of insecurity on the waterways, the shallow draft of the channels which, according to her, hinders the movement of big vessels, as well as problems of poor access roads and rail linkages to the ports in the areas. Usman who spoke at a meeting with members of the House of Representatives Ad-hoc Committee on Ports and Harbour, said, however, that Onne Ports currently function at full capacity. She disclosed that the management of the NPA was working with relevant stakeholders towards tackling the challenges that hamper patronage of the Eastern Ports. According to her, following the approval of dredging contract by the Federal Executive Council last year, dredging works have been completed on deepening the Warri channel draught to 7.5 meters while consultants have been engaged to advise on level of investments needed to improve the infrastructure capacity of the Port Harcourt port. She also said the NPA has granted all requisite approvals for the construction of the Lekki Deep Sea Port for which development has started, noting further that the body was awaiting a response from the promoters of the Badagry Deep Sea Port to enable conclusion on the final outline business case for the project.
