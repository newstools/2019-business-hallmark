The Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) has confirmed it killed dozens of soldiers and captured nine four-wheel vehicles from troops after an ambush between Damasak and Gudumbali on Tuesday. Earlier reports had suggested that nine soldiers were killed and about 30 missing, but ISWAP which has claimed responsibility for the attack, suggests the number is much higher. “Dozens of dead and wounded among the apostate Nigerian Army in the region of (Lake Chad). West African state Tuesday, 11 Muharram 1441AH, by the Grace of God,” the group said in a statement. “The caliphate soldiers ambushed a convoy of the Nigerian Army apostates between the towns of Damasak and Gudumbali and clashed with them with various types of weapons. “Meanwhile, the Mujahideen arrived on another site of the apostates near the town Garno in the region of Lake Chad on Tuesday and clashed with them with medium and heavy weapons.” “Resulting in the death and injury of dozens of them and the destruction of three trucks and armoured vehicles and seizure of nine four-wheel drives and armoured vehicles as well as other weapons and various ammunition, all praise and gratitude be to Allah.”
