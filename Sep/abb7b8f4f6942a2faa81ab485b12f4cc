It was a game of end to end attacks between the Super Eagles of Nigeria and Ukraine which ended in a 2-2 draw. Gernot Rohr’s team wasted no time in mounting pressure on the Ukrainian defense as soon as the referee blew the whistle. Four minutes into the game, Joseph Aribi scored his first goal for the Super Eagles. The pace of the young players combined with skills was too much for the Ukranian side managed by Andry Shevchenko to handle. In the 34th minute, Victor Osimhen made it two goals to nil in favour of Nigeria from the penalty spot. In the second half, the Ukranians dominated the game as they had more possession of the ball. In short, it was a game of two halves as Oleksandr Zinchenko & Roman Yaremchuk goals canceled out the Super Eagles’ first half efforts by Joseph Aribo and Victor Osimhen. Fluid and lovely first half but the team could not handle the pressure in the second half. While Zinchenko’s goal in the 78th minute was brilliant, Yaremchuk’s goal one minute later was controversial as the ball struck his arm before going in.
