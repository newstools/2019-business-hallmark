Convoy of Borno State governor, Babagana Zulum, was on Thursday, attacked by Boko Haram insurgents who opened fire on his entourage. The incident happened around 9pm. Security sources told the Cable that the insurgents attacked the convoy in Konduga while Zulum was returning from a trip to Bama Local Government Area. Zulum had visited Bayo, Kwaya Kusar, Askira Uba and Gwoza as part of his “familiarity and need assessment tour” of the 27 LGAs in the state. The source said, “Luckily the governor, his commissioners and other vehicles in the convoy escaped unhurt but the last vehicle which is an army gun truck was pelted with bullets. “Immediately after they fired at us, our men in collaboration with the armed personnel from the Federal Special Anti Robbery Squad, retaliated and thwarted the ambush.” Konduga, an area near Sambisa forest, has come under many attacks from the faction of Boko Haram under the control of Abubakar Shekau. The attack comes seven months after Kashim Shettima, Zulum’s successor was attacked by the sect on his way to Gamboru Ngala, still in Borno.
