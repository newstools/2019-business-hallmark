The Department of State Services has alleged that some unnamed people are plotting to set the nation on fire.
The spokesperson for the DSS, Peter Afunaya, said this in a statement on Monday. However, the statement did not reveal the identities of the persons involved in the alleged plan to destabilise the nation.
The statement read in part, “The DSS wishes to reiterate its earlier alert to the nation of plans by subversive groups and individuals to undermine national security, peace and unity in the country. “These elements are determined to exploit political differences and other occurrences, within and outside the country, to destabilize the nation. They also initiate narratives to deepen their subversive objectives so as to achieve preferred illegal outcomes. “The aim is to set the country on fire as well as inflame passions across ethnic and religious divides with expected violent consequences.” It warned Nigerians to be wary of fake news, warning people in the habit of spreading false reports to stop or face the consequence.
