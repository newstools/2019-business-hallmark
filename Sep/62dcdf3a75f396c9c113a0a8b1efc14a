Ogun State governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has suspended the N3,700 Parents Teachers Association (PTA) levy paid by students of public primary and secondary schools in the state. The governor who announced the decision in a statement, Friday, said his administration will ensure free education at primary and secondary school levels in the state. “I have suspended with immediate effect, the N3,700 PTA fee inherited from the immediate past administration but rumoured to have been approved by me, to be paid by parents and guardians of students in our State-owned primary and secondary schools,” he said. “I disclosed this in Abeoat the Forum held with stakeholders in our education sector today. I have mandated concerned officials to look at how we can make insurance & accessories, which were part of the details of the fee, work without making our parents & guardians uncomfortable “Our administration promised to offer free education at these levels, and as our performance has so far shown, we will not renege. “In addition to this show of faith, we have, amongst other things, begun rehabilitation of 236 primary and secondary schools in the State and we will focus on teacher training to develop the pro fession and sector. #BuildingOurFutureTogether.”
