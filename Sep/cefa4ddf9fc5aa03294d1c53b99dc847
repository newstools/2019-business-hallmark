Enugu-Onitsha Expressway, a major highway that links Anambra to Enugu and other surrounding states, has remained in very terrible shape despite huge budgetary allocations for its construction since 2005. Although the Anambra government had done parts of the road especially the areas that pass through Awka, the state capital, large portions, especially the Umunya axis, remain undone, subjecting motorists to horrendous experiences daily. Available information from the Budget Office of the Federation and Federal Ministry of Finance suggests that over N45 billion has been budgeted for the road since 2005, but nothing significant has been done on it to improve the suffering of those who ply it. While a completed portion of the road was used extensively for electioneering campaign during the last presidential election, the reality on ground is that for the most part, the road is impassable.
