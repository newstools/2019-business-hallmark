Former UN diplomat and governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2017 Anambra governorship election, Oseloka Henry Obaze has described the death of Ambassador Chiedu Osakwe as a huge loss to the country and to humanity. Obaze said he grew up with the late diplomat in Onitsha, Anambra State and both ended up pursuing careers in diplomacy. “I mourn deeply the passing of a dear brother, friend, and colleague, Amb. Chiedu Osakwe,” he said.
“We both grew up in Onitsha, and were age mates, childhood friends and eventually co-travelers into the world of diplomacy.” Osakwe who died at the weekend, was the Director General and Chief Negotiator, Nigerian Office for Trade Negotiations (NOTN). He was Nigeria’s Chief Trade Negotiator and Director General of the Nigerian Office for Trade Negotiations. He also chaired the Negotiating Forum of the African Union (AU) from June 2017 to March 2018, during which time the negotiations were concluded on the Agreement Establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Previously, he was on the staff of the World Trade Organization Secretariat (1998–2017) during which he was director of a number of WTO divisions. Prior to the WTO Secretariat, he was a Nigerian Foreign Service Officer (1979 to 1998).
