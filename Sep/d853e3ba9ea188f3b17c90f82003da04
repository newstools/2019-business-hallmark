Vocal former minister of aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode has shaded Nigeria’s vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, suggesting that he has spent the past four years commissioning prayer for his ‘boss’, President Muhammadu Buhari to die so he can inherit power. Fani-Kayode, a staunch critic of the Buhari administration, noted without mentioning the vice president’s name, that he should not expect to end well. “When you spend four  years and four months commissioning prayer groups and prayer warriors to pray for your boss to die so you can take over from him you cannot expect to end well,” he wrote via his twitter handle @realFFK. “LOYALTY IS EVERYTHING! They used you like t*ilet paper and now they are going to flush you down the t*ilet.” When you spend 4 years and 4 months commissioning prayer groups and prayer warriors to pray for your boss to die so you can take over from him you cannot expect to end well. LOYALTY IS EVERYTHING! They used you like toilet paper and now they are going to flush u down the toilet. — Femi Fani-Kayode (@realFFK) September 21, 2019  The former minister further argued that Pastor Tunde Bakare, Buhari’s running mate in 2011, who is currently being rumoured to have been penciled to replace Osinbajo as vice president, would have been a better choice, according to him, he has strong character and is loyal. “Rumours abound and if the truth be told, Tunde Bakare would be a much better VP than Prof Osinbajo. I may not agree with him on everything but at least he is loyal. He is courageous, he is strong and he would never betray his people and faith.That is more than I can say for Osubande.” Rumours abound and if the truth be told @T_Bakare would be a much better VP than @ProfOsinbajo.
