Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has insisted that South African investments in Nigeria must be nationalised because the country has shown no remorse for attacks on Nigerians and nationals of other African countries in the latest wave of xenophobia. The former minister who took to his twitter handle @realFFK on Saturday to make the call, also said Nigeria should cut diplomatic ties with the South African nation. “SA has shown no remorse for her barbarity and offered no apology for her hate,” he wrote. “I maintain that we must nationalise their investments and companies, cut diplomatic ties with them, expel their nationals and recall Nigerians that live in SA back home. Bullies only bow to strength!”
