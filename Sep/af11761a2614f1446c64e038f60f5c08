…recommends him for national honours
The House of Representatives has honoured the Chairman of Air Peace, Mr. Allen Onyema, over the free services offered by his domestic airline to evacuate Nigerians under attacks in South Africa.
The Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, shortly after saying the opening prayers, asked that the Order Paper for Wednesday’s plenary be temporarily suspended to allow the lawmakers to receive Onyema for recognition.
As the Chief Whip, Mohammed Monguno, ushered Onyema into the chamber, several lawmakers approached him to embrace and shake hands with him. More lawmakers also approached the Air Peace boss where he was seated to greet him.
“This is one of our epic moments in the chambers. We hereby commend Mr. Allen Onyema and recommend him to the Federal Government for higher honours in Nigeria,” Gbajabiamila said.
The lawmakers gave Onyema a standing ovation when called upon to address them.
“You have brought tears to my eyes again. I have never been so honoured in my life,” Onyema said in the opening of his speech.
