Nigeria has been listed among the ‘Top-20 improvers” in Doing Business for the year 2020’ by World Bank. According to the latest report from the World Bank, the country’s improvements were driven by the operationalization of a new electronic platform that integrates the tax authority and the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). Nigeria, Togo, Zimbabwe, Djibouti and Kenya made the ‘Top-20 improvers” in Africa. The full report on the top 20 reformers globally in Ease of Doing Business rankings will be released on October 24th. “The CAC also upgraded its name reservation platform and, in Kano, there is now an electronic platform for registering business premises online, eliminating the need to appear in person,” the report stated. It also noted that the country made getting electricity easier by allowing certified engineers to conduct inspections for new connections. Initiatives also made commercial litigation of smaller cases more efficient.
