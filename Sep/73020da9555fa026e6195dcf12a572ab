The Federal Government has shelved the idea of state police being clamored for by many Nigerians, arguing instead that the proposed Community Police policy is better and will strengthen security in the country. The Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mr. Mohammed Adamu, who said this on Friday in Abuja during the submission of the report of the Committee on Strengthening Internal Security Framework and Community Policing in Nigeria at the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, argued that state police would require each state government to create, recruit, train, and manage a policing system separate from the federal system, while community policing is engaging the community in every aspect of policing. This, he said, will make policing initiative to come from the community rather than the high command, which according to him, is the best solution. “The advantages of community policing outweigh the idea of state policing, the disadvantages of state policing are more than the perceived advantages,” Adamu said. “So the way to go is by community policing, which will take care of all the demands and agitation for state police.”
