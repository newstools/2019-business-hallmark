Since the arrival of about 185 Nigerians on Wednesday night, from South Africa aboard Air Peace, Nigerians have been hailing the airline for a job well-done. Their arrival followed a wave of xenophobic violence in the South African country. Nigerians took to various social media platforms; especially Twitter to heap praises on Air Peace and its chairman, Allen Onyema for evacuating their compatriots form South Africa. A twitter user with the handle @Coolmajor, wrote, “Allen is the owner of air peace who took his plane to South Africa to evacuate Nigerians. I hope he gets the honour he deserves.” Success Idowu @Idowu553 said “Over 600 Nigerians are on their way from SA. The first batch of the returnees have arrived Lagos. The second batch will be airlifted tomorrow free of charge by Air Peace airline. One man volunteered to send his aircraft to Johannesburg to bring our stranded brothers and sisters back home.” @Ikenna tweeted, “Mr Allen Onyema, CEO of Air Peace, an Igbo man from Mbosi in Anambra State, airlifting Nigerians in SA back home at no extra cost. This is what the government has failed to do. Mr. Allen Onyema, may your source never run dry.” @Omarion_alexi “Shout out to Mr. Allen Onyema, chairman of air peace for going out of his way to fund the flight to bring back our brothers form South Africa. We need more love. He is the real MVP.” At the time of filing this report, it was gathered by Business Hallmark that more Nigerians will be brought back by Air Peace.
