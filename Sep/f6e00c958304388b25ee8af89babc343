The Federal High Court, Abuja, has reportedly warned the Director-General of the Department of State Services (DSS), Yusuf Bichi that his refusal to release publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, in disobedience of court order could fetch him jail time. The warning was contained in a “notice of disobedience to order of court” issued by the court on Thursday and addressed to the DSS DG. The Federal High Court directed the DSS to comply with its directive or face grave consequences, which includes “commitment to prison”. Sowore has remained in detention more than 24 hours after meeting his bail condition as set by Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Tuesday in a ruling. The refusal of DSS to release him has continued to raise concerns. Former minister of education, Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili took to Twitter on Thursday to also express concern over the development. “Why is Omowole Sowore still detained by DSS under the supervision of President Muhammadu Buhari?” she asked via her handle, @obyezeks. “Is there a reason given for this apparent disobedience of court order after Yele’s lawyers fulfilled the condition laid down by Justice Taiwo Taiwo for his release?
WHY???”
