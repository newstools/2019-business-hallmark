Following his victory at the Delta State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Asaba on Friday, the state governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, has extended hands of fellowship to Chief Great Ogboru, candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in the state’s governorship polls. Okowa had won reelection in the March 9th 2019 governorship election under the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) platform, but his victory was challenged by Ogboru at the tribunal. The tribunal on Friday, however, upheld his election. “With today’s ruling, we must now move forward. I call on my brother, Great Ogboru, the candidate of the APC in the March 9th gubernatorial election, to partner with us, and all Deltans, as we work to build a #StrongerDelta for everyone,” Okowa said in a statement via his twitter handle @IAOkowa. “It is my fervent hope and prayer, that the God that has brought us this far, will continue to bless and guide us, as we work to direct the affairs of our state and unite all our people.”
