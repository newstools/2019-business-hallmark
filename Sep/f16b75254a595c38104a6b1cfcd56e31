The Abia State chapter of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) has vowed to challenge the decision of the state’s governorship election petition tribunal which on Friday, upheld the election of Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu in the March 9th gubernatorial election. The tribunal sitting in Umuahia, the state capital, had dismissed a petition brought before it by APGA and its candidate, Dr Alex Otti, asking itl to cancel the result of elections in 15 out of the 17 local government areas in the state and order fresh polls But the state chairman of the party, Nkem Okoro, who spoke to RELIABLESOURCENG.COM, insisted that the tribunal’s decision is a miscarriage of justice. “We do not accept the judgment of the Abia governorship tribunal. We believe that the tribunal has not done a thorough job. But for now, the tribunal has ruled and it’s the law,” Okoro said. “Our lawyers are going to obtain the judgment and brief us before we take the next step. We have 14 days to do that, but we are glad we have two more levels (Appeal Court and Supreme Court), in the pursuit of our case. “We are in no way discouraged. Our spirit remains very high and I can tell you it’s the same with our candidate. “This battle is about the deliverance of Abia State from the hands of those who have held it captive, for the past over 20 years. It is not just about Alex Otti becoming governor or APGA taking over power. “It is about development of the state; it is about the welfare and well-being of the people – the teachers, health workers, civil servants, pensioners, the elderlies, the youth, the unemployed, traders, all of us who have been at the receiving end of PDP’s misrule in Abia State.” Asked whether the party and its candidate will appeal the judgment, the chairman said: “The chances of going on appeal is very high and as such we advise our opponents not to celebrate too soon.”
