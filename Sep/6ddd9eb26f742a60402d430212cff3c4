National Publicity Secretary of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Kola Ologbondiyan has mocked Nigeria’s vice president, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, noting that his office has now been reduced to “VP Academics.” Ologbondiyan’s remarks followed a Twitter comment made by the Director General, Media and Communications to the Kano State Government, Salihu Yakasai to the effect that Osinbajo is as “vice president academics.” The PDP spokesperson said via his Twitter handle @officialKolaO, that “It is most unfortunate that the highly exalted seat of the VP has been reduced to “VP Academics”, but then that’s what you get when you aide and abate tyranny.” Yakasai had via his account, @dawisu, on Tuesday, posted the controversial tweet, which seemed to mock Osinbajo in response to another user, Ismail Kabir, who had said, “It seems everyone in Nigeria is in New York for UN Assembly,” to which Yakasai replied, “Vice President (Academics) is still around sir.” The comment had caused controversy on Twitter, with many suggesting that President Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari is the VP Administration, while Osinbajo is VP Academics. However after coming under fire, Yakasai described himself as a “huge fan” of Osinbajo.
