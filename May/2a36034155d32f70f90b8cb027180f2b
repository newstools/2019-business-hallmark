According to a report from top Italian journalist, Fabrizio Romano over the weekend, Antonio Conte has chosen his next project, and is set to return to football management by signing a four-year deal with Inter Milan. Conte spent the entire 2018-19 season on hiatus after his bad breakup with Chelsea, where the club sacked him without paying the severance he was entitled to an issue that eventually went to arbitration where it presumably got resolved (although no one has reported on its actual resolution). In the meantime, several clubs had reportedly been interested in Conte, especially back in Italy. According to reports, Roma were interested in hiring a top class manager in the person of Conte, while Juventus, his former club are considering him as the replacement for Massimiliano Allegri. But it would appear that Inter Milan who are expected to let go of Luciano Spaletti, are going to win this race. Conte during his time at Chelsea never hid the fact that he missed home. Going back to Italy has always been part of his plan. If he seals a move to Inter Milan, the club would be able to attract world class players in addition to the quality players at their disposal. The Italian Serie A will be more competitive next season if Inter pull this off.
