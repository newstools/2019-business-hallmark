Former governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido, has asked former president, Olusegun Obasanjo not to allow his disappointment with the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari to turn him to a religious and ethnic bigot. Lamido was reacting to an earlier statement by Obasanjo alleging that Boko Haram and Fulani herdsmen were on a mission to ‘Fulanise’ ‘Islamise’ the country and Africa. The former president was quoted as saying that “the twin evils of Boko Haram and marauding cattle herders were initially treated with kid gloves. “Its no longer an issue of lack of education and lack of employment for our youth in Nigeria which it began as, it is now West African Fulanization, Islamization and global organised crimes of human trafficking, money laundering, drug trafficking, gun trafficking, illegal mining and regime change.” But in a reaction through his media aide Mansur Ahmad on Sunday, Lamido called on the former president to withdraw his remarks. He noted that he believes Mr Obasanjo’s statement was improper for a nationalist. “If it were said at a non-religious venue to a non-religious audience, maybe; it might have been more tolerable. “Please, sir don’t let your disappointment with sitting presidents turn you into a bigot. You must not abandon the national stage. “The cracks along the various divides in our National cohesion are already turning into huge gorges,” Mr Lamido said.
