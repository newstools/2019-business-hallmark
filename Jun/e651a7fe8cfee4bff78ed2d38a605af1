The Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) has suspended the license of Daar Communications PLC. The Director General of the NBC, Modibbo Kawu stated this Thursday evening while briefing journalists in Abuja. He said, Daar communications have turned themselves into a bad example of what a broadcast station should be. African Independent Television (AIT) and Raypower are under Daar communications which is owned by Chief Raymond Dokpesi. According to a reliable source this suspension may not be unconnected with the documentary titled ‘The Real Buhari’ that was aired on the TV station about President Muhammadu Buhari in the build up to the 2015 general election.
