The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had few days ago barred Oando Plc CEO, Wale Tinubu and the deputy, Omamofe Boyo  from managing any publicly quoted company for five years. The Commission subsequently constituted an Interim Management Team (IMT) headed by Mr. Mutiu Sunmonu, to oversee the management of the company and conduct an Extra-Ordinary General Meeting on or before July 1, 2019. Meanwhile, a Federal High Court sitting in Lagos has restrained SEC from removing Tinubu and Boyo, even as the company’s stock plunged amid the crisis.
