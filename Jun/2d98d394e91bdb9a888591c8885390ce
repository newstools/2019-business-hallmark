Dozens of solders were feared killed on Wednesday when suspected ISWAP/Boko Haram fighters dislodged troops in northern part of Borno state. The incident occurred at Kareto village in Mobbar Local Government Area of the state. A source who witnessed the attack told Daily Trust that solders could not repel the insurgents who managed to dislodge their location. “The attack was not repelled and troops at the locations were dislodged. Dozens were killed, but details are scanty on casualties,” the source said, noting that more attacks are imminent. “The attacks are not going to cease as Boko Haram terrorists are desperate. There is urgent need to inform all units in the axis covering Damasak, Mallam Fatori, Magumeri, Gubio to be on high alert as the terrorists are emboldened to launch more attacks during the rainy season.”
