The Nigerian Police Force (NPF) has rejected suggestion by the British Foreign and Commonwealth office that 21 of the country’s 36 states were unsafe and should be avoided by British citizens, insisting that the country, although has security challenges just like other countries, is safe and beautiful. Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Frank Mba stated this in a statement on Thursday. “The attention of the Nigeria Police Force has been drawn to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice against all travel to some States and border areas in Nigeria,” the statement read. “While the Nigeria Police acknowledge that Nigeria is not without some security challenges, just like other nations of the World, including the advanced democracies, we wish to restate that Nigeria remains one of the most beautiful places to live in the World. It is a safe country with its own peculiar socio-economic and security challenges. “We therefore wish to reassure Nigerians and the International Community of their safety and the commitment of the Police and other security agencies to continue to provide effective security services to the nation.” The British Foreign and Commonwealth office had on Tuesday, warned British citizens against traveling to 21 Nigerian states on account of insecurity.
