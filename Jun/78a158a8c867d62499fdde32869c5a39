The South East Geopolitical zone has lost out in the leadership of the three arms of government as Femi Gbajabiamila from Lagos State, South West and Idris Ahmed Wase from Plateau State, North Central emerge Speaker of the House of Representatives and Deputy Speaker respectively in the 9th Assembly. Gbajagbiamila, representing Surulere I Federal Constituency of Lagos State, was the preferred candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC). He polled 282 votes to defeat his challenger, Umar Bago representing Chanchaga Federal Constituency of Niger State, who got 76 votes and was accordingly declared winner by the Returning Officer, who is the Clark of the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani-Omolori on Tuesday. Mr Gbajabamila was nominated by Abdulmumin Jibrin from Kano State , while Mr Bago was nominated by Abubakar Mohammed of Yamaltu-Deba Federal Constituency of Gombe State Meanwhile, Wase, lawmaker representing Wase Federal Constituency of Plateau State in the House of Representatives, emerged as the Deputy Speaker unopposed. Earlier, Senator Ahmed Lawan from Yobe State, North East emerged Senate President, while Senator Ovie Omo-Agege from Delta, South South emerged Deputy Senate President. The implication of their emergence is that the South East heads no arm of government under the present administration. President Muhammadu Buhari, head of the executive, is from Katsina, North West. The vice president, Yemi Osinbajo is from Ogun, South West. Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Mohammad, head of the judiciary, is from Bauchi, North East; while Lawan, head of the legislature is from Yobe, North East. Again, this will be the first time since 1999 that the leadership of all arms of government will be headed by people of Muslim faith. President Buhari, Justice Muhammad and Lawan are all Northern Muslims, while Gbajabiamila is a Southern Muslim.
