The Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum, Atiku Bagudu, has said governors are grateful to President Muhammadu Buhari for the release of about two trillion naira to the 36 states of the federation. Bagudu stated this when he addressed State House correspondents at the end of a closed-door meeting between President Buhari and governors elected under the platform of the All Progressives Congress in Abuja on Tuesday. The Kebbi State governor said, “Furthermore, we used the opportunity to thank Mr. President for all he has been doing and all the successes recorded in the areas which he campaigned upon, which are security, economy and accountability. “We are quite happy with his support for states where close to N2 trillion was given to states in the form of restructuring of loans, refunds on federal roads, refund for Paris Club, which has helped encouraged economic activities in the states, payment of salaries, payment of pensions, payment of gratuities and overall investment by infrastructural spending. “We are also appreciative of increased investment in agriculture which has been because of conscious decision to support agriculture as a way out of economic challenges and provide economic growth,’’ he said. On the meeting between the president and the governors, Bagudu said they were in the villa to congratulate the president on the National Assembly elections and to thank him for the confidence he had in the members of the forum. Bagudu added, “We offer to work with Mr President to ensure that we increase economic performance, the security of our country and social cohesion.” (NAN)
