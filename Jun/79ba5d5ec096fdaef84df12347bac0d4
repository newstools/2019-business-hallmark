The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has secured final forfeiture of N49 seized at the Kaduna International Airport on March 14, 2017.
Justice M. Shuaibu of the Federal High Court sitting in Kaduna, ordered the final forfeiture of the N49million to the Federal Government on Friday. The cash which were stashed in five large 150kg sacks was intercepted by EFCC operatives following intelligence report received by the Kaduna Zonal Office. The EFCC said it had earlier obtained an interim forfeiture order, after which some persons showed up and laid claim to the intercepted cash.
They filed a counter-affidavit against EFCC’s motion for final forfeiture in suit No: FHC/KD/CS/32/17 Oyebanji Olaitan Steve & others Vs EFCC. Consequently, the court ordered for oral evidence to be taken as there were conflicts in the affidavits filed by the parties. In his ruling, Justice Shuaibu granted EFCC’s motion for the final forfeiture of the money and dismissed the claims of the applicants.
