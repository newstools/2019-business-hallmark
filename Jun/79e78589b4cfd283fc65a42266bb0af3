Kano State governor Abdullahi Ganduje, on Thursday, issued a query to the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, to respond to allegations of misappropriation of funds levelled against him. The development is the latest in what is a running feud between the governor and the Emir It would be recalled that the Kano State Anti-Corruption and Public Complaint Commission on Monday indicted the emir and recommended his suspension. Munir Sanusi, the chief of staff to the Emir who confirmed the query said the state government sought the response of the the monarch within 24 hours. “We received the query today. The state government has demanded the response of His Highness within 24 hours. The council is studying the content,” he said. Sanusi has been under an onslaught from the governor who appears determined to dispose him. On Wednesday, the Emir cancelled Hawan Nassarawa durbar in deference to the directive of the state governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, seeking cancellation of the traditional event. The governor had ordered the cancellation of the durbar, citing security reasons. Few weeks ago Ganduje named new emirs in an apparent move to whittle down Sanusi’s influence.
