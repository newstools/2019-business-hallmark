Nigeria’s female football team, the Super Falcons, has made it to the round of 16 in the ongoing Women World Cup in France. Falcons took up one of the best losers spot on Thursday evening following Chile’s 2 – 0 victory over Thailand. The South American nation needed to have scored at least three goals against Thailand to qualify ahead of Nigeria. Heading into the match against Thailand, Chile had -5 goals deficit while Nigeria has -2 after three matches. Both Chile and Nigeria ended with three points but Nigeria has qualified ahead of them because they now have -3 goal deficit to Nigeria’s -2. The Super Falcons will face Germany in the round of 16 in what will be the second time that the Nigerian team would be making it beyond the group stage in the tournament. Earlier on Friday, fellow African side, Cameroon, beat New Zealand 2-1 to qualify for the second. Although Cameroon also has -2 goal deficit and three points like Nigeria, they had qualified ahead of Falcons because they have fewer yellow cards than Nigeria. Nigeria had picked up a red card against France which had also compounded their challenge.
