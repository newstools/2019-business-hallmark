Vocal and often brash, former British Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson has been likened to US President, Donald Trump. Both share similar conservative views, somewhat look alike. And upon Theresa May’s announcement of her decision to quit weeks ago, Trump did not hesitate to break diplomatic protocol to point out that Johnson, would make a fantastic Prime Minister. The US President’s wish is almost certain to materialise. Barring extraordinary turn of events, Johnson seems all set to replace Mrs. May next month. Although the race to succeed May as leader of the ruling Conservative Party is ongoing, Johnson is the clear frontrunner and has only one remaining opponent, Jeremy Hunt, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. The winner of that race will be decided in a ballot of the 124,000 or so card-carrying Conservative Party members. They are significantly more right-wing, more pro-Brexit and more white than the average British citizen. And Boris Johnson, according to Time, “is their darling.” Johnson is a Conservative lawmaker and former journalist. He is known for being a former Mayor of London and a leading figure on the “leave” side of the 2016 Brexit referendum. Following his side’s success, he was installed as Foreign Secretary. After a tenure characterized by gaffes, he stepped down in July 2018 over May’s Brexit negotiating strategy. Now he is a so-called “backbench” lawmaker who doesn’t hold government office, but is still seen as a leading Brexiter according to Time.
