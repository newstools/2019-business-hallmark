Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike has declared free education for primary and secondary students in the state. The governor who took to his twitter handle, @GovWike to make the announcement on Monday, noted that fees paid by students in the school were only used for personal purposes and hence should be stopped. “From today henceforth, no child either in primary and secondary schools should pay fees and levies in any school across the State,” he wrote. “The monies you collect from these children are just used for your personal purposes. If I hear that any school head collects any fees or levies, be the examination , NECO or WAEC fees, that school head would be sanctioned. “We shall not only dismiss the school head who collects fees or levies, we will prosecute the person involved. Government will work out grants that will be sent to the schools for their regular management and operations . State Ministry of Education, the Rivers State Senior Secondary Schools Board and the State Universal Basic Education Board should monitor all public schools across the state to ensure compliance. The administration funds the salaries, allowances, examinations and equipment of all public schools. My administration will remain committed to the provision of quality education, which is accessible to the less privileged. I have abolished all fees and levies and it will never happen again in our public primary and Secondary schools. Nobody should collect fees and levies from the children of the less privileged .
