The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has stated that it would not effect any change in the country’s exchange rate structure. Isaac Okoroafor, CBN’s Director, Corporate Communication who gave the assurance in a statement on Wednesday, said it was in reaction to several reports that the Nigerian naira rate will be determined by the market. “There has been no change in Nigeria’s exchange rate structure, Okoroafor said. “The CBN has not floated the naira. The exchange rate remains stable. Speculations and reports to the contrary are false.” The apex bank’s governor, Godwin Emefiele had consistently expressed CBN commitment to sustain the high level of stability in the forex market by continuous interventions.
