Bandits on Saturday morning killed three brothers in Zaka village, Safana Local Government Area of Katsina State. The victims’ remains were brought to the palace of the Emir of Katsina, Abdulmumin Kabir, later in the evening, accompanied by their aged mother. They were, however, advised by palace officials to return the corpses to the village for burial. Spokesman for the Katsina Emirate Council, Mallam Iro Bindawa who gave the advice, asked them to request the district head of the village to write to the palace, detailing the circumstances surrounding the incident. “The emir sympathised with them and advised that the corpses be taken to the village for burial,” he said. “The victims are of the same mother. Four of them were on the farm when the bandits attacked them but one of them managed to escape.” The spokesman for the police in the state, SP Gambo Isah, also confirmed the incident.
