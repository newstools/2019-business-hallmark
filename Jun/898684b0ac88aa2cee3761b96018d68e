Leaders of Yoruba sociopolitical group, Afenifere on Tuesday met with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, and demanded for true federalism to address the challenges facing the country. The group led by Pa Ayo Fasanmi, made four other requests cutting across security, education, youth employment and power supply. The demands were contained in a speech read by Senator Olabiyi Durojaiye. Reading the speech Durojaiye said: “We seriously recommend clinging to the spirit and letters of our federal constitution. This is one sure way of achieving the desired goals of unity even in diversity, mutual respect, tolerance and giving true meaning to the opening phrase of our constitution that is, ‘we the people.’” “We will be a greater nation if we sincerely practice true federalism, think and act as Nigerians rather than as champions of the smaller units we were born into. Our big size is an asset worthy of preservation,” said. “Good examples of big size, hard work and prudent spending are the USA, China and India. It is not with violence or hate speeches but with mutual trust, self-respect and tolerance that we will speedily achieve the lofty destiny of the great country, Nigeria. Among those who attended the meeting were Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Chief Segun Osoba, Sen. Abiola Ajimobi, Sen. Adedayo Adeyeye, Chief Kemi Nelson, Laoye Tomori, Solomon Akindele, Elder Yemi Alade and Mutiu Are
