The groups which took the position at joint press conference on Sunday at Ikeja, Lagos, said it has become expedient to demand action in the wake of the “recent wave of crisis, killings, kidnapping and community invasion by armed bandits, under the aegis of Fulani Herdsmen, ISIS ISWA and Boko Haram.” The groups expressed regret over what they called the inaction of President Muhammadu Buhari in the wake of the persistent killings, while declaring that: “We Say No To The Fulanization of Our Common Patrimony: Nigeria.” “We are deeply concerned, as critical stakeholders in the Nigerian project, that Muhammadu Buhari led Federal Government has allowed the ongoing Fulanization of Nigeria as seen in the terrorism, mass murder and genocidal war unleashed on innocent Nigerians in various communities across the nation by the armed bandits under the aegis of Fulani Herdsmen, ISIS, ISWA and Boko Haram terrorist group, despite the huge billions of dollars sunk into the anti terrorism war,” the groups said in a joint statement by Aremo Oladotun Hassan, President, Yoruba Council of Youths Worldwide and Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, President, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, represented by Comrade Obinnna Achionye, Deputy President, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council. They took exception to proposals by the Buhari government to set up cattle colony, Fulani radio and the alleged donation of N100 billion to herdsmen. The statement said YCYW was reversing the time of an earlier scheduled summit on June 27 from 11am to 9am in order to mobilize “all our guests to honour the Late Sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo’s book lunch, on the translation of all Papa’s works into Yoruba Language program organized by Alaroye Magazine, slated for same 27th of June, 2019 at the International Conference Centre, University of Ibadan, Oyo State billed to commence by 11a.m.” It further disclosed that a date in 2019 will be mutually agreed between the two regions on the convening of a Joint South West and South East Security Summit. The groups presented 13-point demand it tagged “National Charter of Demands” as follows: “1. We demand the immediate enactment of a new people’s National and Regional Constitution(s) respectively. 2.
