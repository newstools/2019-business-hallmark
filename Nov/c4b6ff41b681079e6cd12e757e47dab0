By ADEBAYO OBAJEMU When this reporter asked 15-year-old Uche, a pupil of Baptist Academy, Obanikoro, Lagos, who is his role model, he quickly said,” I want to be like Davido or Whizkid.” When asked why he would prefer to be like those artistes he had mentioned instead of an Achebe or a Soyinka, his reply was even more shocking. “Are they footballers or singers too?” This reporter took time to explain to him that Wole Soyinka and Chinua Achebe are international writers from Nigeria, widely respected, but the teenager was not concerned, he said he does not want to be like them since they are not given money by Glo or MTN as their Ambassadors. There have been concerns lately about the social responsibility of most companies in Nigeria, especially the big blue chip ones like MTN, Glo, Airtel, Nigeria Breweries and others. Most commentators say big multinationals and successful indigenous companies have a wrong set of values when it comes to fulfilling their social responsibility role as they are alleged to prefer spending on entertainment and music in general instead of on academic research and things of beneficial value to the society. However, this situation may change as Nigerian banks are falling beside themselves to impress and win over the people with their public spirited programmes and initiatives as part of the corporate social responsibility, CSR. It has never been this good for the public and banks have suddenly taken CSR as major part of their operations. Business Hallmark takes a look at the social responsibility content of some banks in 2018. Top banks including GTBank, Zenith Bank, Access Bank, FirstBank of Nigeria (FBN), United Bank of Africa (UBA) and 10 others are playing in the social sector. According to BusinessHallmark’s findings these banks spent over N8 billion on their Corporate Social Responsibilities in 2018. While Zenith Bank Plc spent N3.06 billion, UBA spent N1.04 billion, GTBank spent N928.07 million, FBN spent N831 million, Access Bank (N376.75 million), FCMB (N315.80), Sterling Bank (N299.01 million), Stanbic IBTC (N233.40 million), Fidelity (N158.36 million), Wema Bank (N34.62 million), Union Bank (N30.20 million) and Unity Bank (N13.38 million). GTBank GTBank spent a lot of money on arts, community development, education and others. Arts — N49.70 million The bank initiated Painting the future for tomorrow’s leaders when it engaged children with a 4-week Art635 Summer programme where they explored and harnessed their creativity through painting, sketching and photography. It also promoted creative expressions through writing, harnessed art for economic development, conducted capacity building for female photographers, and preserved historical artefacts and monuments among others. Community Development – N326.61 million It launched a nationwide campaign, tagged “#SimpleChangeBigImpact” through which it collaborated with individuals and groups to invest in the social infrastructure of 20 communities nationwide.

Anthony Emmanuel, a trend analyst and writer said GTBANK has upped its social responsibility quotient by investing in arts, infrastructure, education and the environment. “where they put money are the key areas, talk of education, environment and infrastructure, at least that’s of more benefit to society at large than giving money to artistes who are individuals. They are other areas especially education where corporate world needs to invest,because any investment in research will be of benefit to society. “  Zenith Bank The bank spent N3.06 billion on various states governments’ security funds (N1.57 billion).

Their social responsibility is more defined, more relevant and more in tune with social need of the society. But the same thing cannot be said of the manufacturing sector like Nigeria Breweries and others who invest in less valuable things such as entertainment or reality show, things that have no direct benefit to society. “
