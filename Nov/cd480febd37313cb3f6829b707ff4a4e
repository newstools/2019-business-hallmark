Televisions can be found in billions of homes around the world. But 100 years ago, nobody even knew what a television was. Since replacing radio as the most popular mass medium in the 1950s, television has played such an integral role in modern life that, for some, it is difficult to imagine being without it. Both reflecting and shaping cultural values, television has at times been criticized for its alleged negative influences on children and young people and at other times lauded for its ability to create a common experience for all its viewers. How such a ground-breaking technology turn from a niche invention to a living room mainstay remains one of the most interesting story about human development over the last decades. Interestingly, the world’s first electronic television was created by a 21 year old inventor named Philo Taylor Farnsworth. That inventor lived in a house without electricity until he was age 14. Starting in high school, he began to think of a system that could capture moving images, transform those images into code, then move those images along radio waves to different devices. We can see the advancement and the evolutionary journey of how the TV resolution and picture quality have improved in the last 20 years. The changeover from analog to digital television technology was a slow process, and it wasn’t until the mid-1990s that HDTV broadcasting began. At that time, most HDTVs were plasma TVs, which were expensive, so HDTV adoption was slow. By the mid-2000s however, affordable 40-inch LCDs started to be sold. By the end of the decade, LCD HDTVs were outselling traditional cathode ray tube (CRT) TVs as well as plasma TVs. Post HDTVs, companies started looking for newer technologies that could be offered to consumers. The last few years have including curved screens, high dynamic range (HDR), smart TVs, OLED TVs, and 4K. Now with the hyperrealist detail and picture quality of 8K available to consumers, the next generation of TVs are upon us. <img class="size-medium wp-image-30773 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LG-AI-TV.jpg?resize=420%2C236&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="420" height="236" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LG-AI-TV.jpg?resize=420%2C236&amp;ssl=1 420w, https://i2.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LG-AI-TV.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LG-AI-TV.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LG-AI-TV.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LG-AI-TV.jpg?resize=747%2C420&amp;ssl=1 747w, https://i2.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LG-AI-TV.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LG-AI-TV.jpg?resize=681%2C383&amp;ssl=1 681w, https://i2.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LG-AI-TV.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i2.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LG-AI-TV.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" data-recalc-dims="1" />  One of the major factors that influence TV preference in many homes today is the picture quality.

LG B9 and C9 come with a slim design without distinctive design elements, whereas E9 has a glass design and W9 has the special wallpaper design with a separate electronics box that doubles as a soundbar with Dolby Atmos. This makes the actual W9 screen extremely thin. The company said that it is planning to increase its focus on large-format TVs as market data reveals that consumers have a big appetitive for 70″+ TVs. In this segment, LCD TVs rule as they are much more affordable.
