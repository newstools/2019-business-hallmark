The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Engr. Musa Wada, has rejected the result of the election announced so far by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. Business Hallmark gathered that, the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, who is also the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is leading with a very wide margin in the results announced so far. Governor Bello is ahead of Wada and Natasha Akpoti, the candidate of the Social Democratic Party, SDP with over 200, 000 votes margin in 15 out of the 21 local government areas where results have been officially announced. Addressing newsmen in Lokoja on Sunday, Wada, said the results announced so far were being written to favour the APC. He said that the deputy governor of the state, Chief Edward Onoja with security agencies were moving freely and visiting collation centers where he changed results to favour his party. He also complained that APC rigged the election with the result of Kogi Central, adding that he and his party, PDP will challenge the result in court. “The result is not true reflection of what happened. The people of the state voted for PDP but APC changed the result to favour them. “Results declared so far by INEC is a written result and we can’t accept that. Every single result was changed and we are going to challenge the election. The election is not true reflection of what happened in the field. “I am the candidate of the party and I don’t have to wait till they kill me. I have to cry out to the people of Nigeria to know that APC rigged the election.”
