The Nigerian equity market reversed the positive sentiment that has been reigned for some days, as it declined 0.56 per cent on Tuesday on the back of profit-taking by investors.

The bourse’s decline was spurred by losses recorded in large and medium capitalised stocks, amongst which are: MTN Nigeria, Unilever Nigeria, Access Bank, Dangote Cement and United Bank for Africa.
