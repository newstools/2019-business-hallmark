Former Kaduna Central senator, Shehu Sani has criticised the proposal by President Muhammadu Buhari to borrow $30 billion to ‘fund 39 emergency projects.’ Sani who took to his twitter handle, @ShehuSani on Friday to condemn the move, pointed out that if those in power today has been in opposition, they would have organised protests against the plan. “I have no doubt that if those occupying the position of power today were in the opposition and the government made a request to borrow $30 billion, they could have not just condemned it but will lead a protest against it no matter the reasons advanced,” he said. President Buhari had on Wednesday, re-presented the 2016-2018 $30 billion External Borrowing Plan of the federal government to the Senate for approval. The plan, approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) in August, 2016 and sent to the Senate in November 2016, was however rejected by the eighth Senate. The president has, therefore, re-presented the borrowing plan to the ninth Senate for approval and a letter to that effect was on Thursday read at plenary by the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan. In the request letter, President Buhari informed the upper legislative chamber that the borrowed fund will be used to fund 39 emergency projects in the power, agriculture, road and mining sectors of the nation’s economy.
