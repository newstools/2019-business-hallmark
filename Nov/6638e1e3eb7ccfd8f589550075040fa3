Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun called for deregulation of Nigeria’s oil sector to make funds available for the provision of basic amenities to the people. The governor who made the call when he received members of the Depot and Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (DPMAN) who came on a courtesy call in his office in Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, said it was becoming increasingly difficult to provide infrastructure, hence the need to embark on deregulation. “We can actually embark on deregulation and the savings will be a trillion Naira, and if these savings are put into road infrastructure, the citizens of Nigeria would appreciate it,” he said. The governor said the biggest problem confronting the people is the deplorable state of infrastructure, recalling that “in the course of my campaign, we realised that the biggest problem that our people have is the state of our intra-city and township roads. That is the biggest problem. “If you just fix roads in this State and do nothing else, our people will be happy because it facilitates every other thing. If people can move from point A to point B, they can transport their children to school, they can move their products to markets and go to work on good roads; they would be happy,” he said. The Governor pointed out that he was not yet impressed by the marginal drop on local consumption of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) from 56 to 53 million litres per day due to border closure, stated that the drop was an indication that only little has been achieved. “NNPC showed some numbers that arose from the border closure, that the consumption of fuel had dropped from 56 to 53 million litres daily. It shows that we have achieved very little. When you look at the N145 charged in Nigeria and the N320 that is charged in neighbouring countries, there is more than enough to go round to satisfy everybody, so we cannot continue to deceive ourselves. We must do something about it.”
