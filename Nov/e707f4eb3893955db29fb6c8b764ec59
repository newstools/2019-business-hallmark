The All Progressives Congress (APC) has rejected the judgment of the Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa which ruled that the party has no candidate in the Bayelsa State governorship election on Saturday. The APC said at a press briefing on Thursday that it would appeal the judgement as its lawyers were already working on the processes to first secure a stay of execution. A Federal High Court in Yenagoa presided over byJustice Jane Inyang, had earlier on Thursday declared that the All Progressives Congress (APC) didn’t follow constitutional guidelines in its primaries hence the party has no candidate for the November 16th election in the state. One of the APC governorship aspirants, Senator Heineken Lopkobiri had earlier approached the court asking it to declare him, and not David Lyon, the authentic candidate of the APC. Counsel to Lopkobiri in reaction to Thursday’s court ruling described the judgment as strange. According to him, the judgment delivered was not part of their prayer when they approached the court. The court ruling is coming two days to the election.
