The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has disclosed that the arrested suspected Lebanese fraudster, Hamza Koudeih has laundered a whooping $19million from Nigeria. Koudeih, said to be the partner of Ismaila Mustapha, alias Mompha, a social media ‘big boy’ who was arrested earlier over allegations of financial fraud, according to EFCC, owns $1.3million residential apartment at Eko Atlantic Pearl Tower as well as several exotic cars, but had no other business in the country other than money laundering. “Hamza Koudeih is a Lebanese, resident in Lagos and steeped in money. From his $1.3million residence in Eko Atlantic Pearl Tower to his high-end automobiles,” the agency said via its twitter handle @officialEFCC on Sunday. “Hamza Koudeih oozes money, all of which he made doing nothing in the country but money laundering. According to investigation, he has done this to the tune of a whooping $19million. “The acting Chairman of the EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, described the recent arrests of a social media celebrity, Ismaila Mustapha, popularly known as Mompha for his alleged involvement in internet-related fraud and money laundering and Koudeih, his international collaborator, as a landmark achievement of the Commission in the recent time.”
