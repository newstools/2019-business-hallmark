Nigeria’s vice president, Prof Yemi Osinbajo has dismissed as fake, a list of his aides said to have been sacked by President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday. He called on Nigerians to ignore it. The vice president who spoke via his spokesperson, Laolu Akande on Thursday, also addressed the reported scuffle between his security details and a journalist at the presidential villa, calling it ‘needles scuffle.’ Akande wrote: “The needless scuffle btw a villa accredited photographer, Mr. Adeshida and one of our security aides earlier today has since been resolved. “Incident is regretted and I have apologized to him for any embarrassment caused. Also, a list circulating in the media on d so-called sacked presidential aides is not genuine and ought to be ignored.”
