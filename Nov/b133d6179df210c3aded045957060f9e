Nigeria’s National Power Grid, it appears, has once again collapsed leading to power failure across the country on Friday night. Many Nigerians took to social media to report power failures in their respective areas around 11:30 pm on Friday. The trigger of the failure cannot yet be confirmed as spokesperson for the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) had not been reached at the time of writing. However, both Eko Electricity Distribution Company (Eko Disco) and Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (Abuja Disco) have confirmed that their transmission systems collapsed Friday night. “Power Update: At 2315hrs, we experienced a system collapse across all transmission stations. Supply was received at 0315hrs. Sadly, at 0438hrs, the system collapsed again. TCN & our team are working to restore supply. Kindly bear with us,” Eko Disco wrote Saturday morning via their twitter handle, @EKEDP. Similarly, Abuja Disco in response to a twitter user, Oluwadamilare Bakare @aedcelectricity who inquired to know from them, the reason for the blackout, explained that it was due to grid system outage. “Good day Oluwadamilare, our apologies for the outage. The loss of power supply is due to a grid system outage. We sincerely regret this and hope for quick restoration. We will keep you updated as time goes by. We appreciate your understanding,” the Disco wrote via their handle, @aedcelectricity This will be one of the many major collapses to happen this year alone. There had been at least eight collapses that plunged substantial parts of the country into darkness.
