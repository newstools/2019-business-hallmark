The Nigerian Ministry of Works and Housing has been urged to implement the National Building Code to reduce cases of collapse buildings in the Country.

Sponsored of the motion, Mr. Wale Raji from Lagos State attributed the frequent cases of building collapse in the country to negligence and lack of professionalism.
The lawmaker noted that strict adherence to the building code would address the menace and save lives and property from avoidable loss.
“The incidences of building collapse across the country have reached alarming proportion, with on less than 60 cases within the last 4 years, according to a report by the Federal Ministry of works and Housing, resulting in tragic loss of lives and destruction of property.
The frequent cases of building collapse can be attributed to negligence on the part of contractors, client and professionals, faulty designs, lack of professional supervision and adherence to the Building code, lack of effectiveness of government agencies responsible for monitoring building procurement and construction processes, quackery at pre and post contract stages and the use of substandard materials, among others,” he said.
Adopting the motion the lawmakers also urged the standard Organization of Nigeria to sanitize the building materials sector to get rid of sub-standard goods in the market. (VON)
