World human rights body, Amnesty International has asked the Nigerian government to fish out politicians inciting violence in today’s governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states. The Director, Amnesty Nigeria, Osy Ojigho who made the call in a statement on Saturday, also called on political parties to publicly denounce violence perpetrated by their members. “Politicians inciting violence in Bayelsa and Kogi must be fished out and made to face justice,” he said. “Political parties and candidates must publicly condemn any advocacy of hatred or incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.” Saturday’s polls in the two states had witnessed incidents of ballot box snatching and killing of yet to be ascertained number of people. Voting, meanwhile, has long closed. Exit polls from wards so far show that in Bayelsa, the All Progressive Congress (APC) is ahead of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). On the other hand, the PDP is leading the APC in Kogi where the incumbent governor and candidate of the APC, Yahaya Bello is seeking second term. In the meantime, the Independent National Electoral Commission has announced that there won’t be collation of results tonight as all arrangements will be against tomorrow (Sunday).
