Nigeria’s president, Muhammadu Buhari has said it was unfortunate that the ongoing ‘reorganisation’ of the presidency which, according to him, prompted the disengagement of 35 aides attached to the office of the vice president, Yemi Osinbajo has been given ethnic and political interpretations. The president who spoke while fielding questions from State House Correspondents at the Presidential Wing of Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, shortly after his arrival from London on Friday night, explained that the ongoing reorganisation at the Villa is aimed at enhancing service delivery to Nigerians. “They said 35 people were sacked in the Vice President’s office. We just created some ministries and we reorganized and people are giving it ethnic and political dimensions. It is unfortunate,” he said. Responding to a question on what next for his administration after his rest in London, the President said his administration would work harder and be more accountable. “We are going to work harder and be accountable. We have tried to make Nigerians understand why we do certain things. Accountability from bottom to top is absolutely necessary. “Whoever is responsible for government property, [should know] it is public property, it is not personal and he has to manage it according to the law. “That’s what I expect and I think that we have been around long enough to impress on people that we mean what we say.”
