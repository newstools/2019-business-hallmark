 Anambra State governor, Chief Willie Obiano has hinted that he may pay above the N30,000 minimum wage approved by the Federal Government. Obiano who gave the hint while addressing members of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees at 7th Quadrennial State Conference in Awka, assured the state’s workers that no state would pay higher than Anambra in minimum wage. Lagos State which has promised to pay N35,000 is the highest so far. The governor who was represented by the Head of Service, Harry Uduh, announced that workers in the state would receive their leave allowances on or before December 5th, while their December salaries would be paid on the 15th of December. “We will surprise workers in the state when the implementation of the minimum wage would start,” Punch quoted him as saying. “The state government and organised Labour are in partnership in the development of the state so your requests are not misplaced.”
