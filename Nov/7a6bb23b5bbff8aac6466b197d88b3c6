By JULIUS ALAGBE This season may not be the best for most top banks in the country as their improved profitability is being discounted in the share prices on the stock market, which is unusually, as earnings and profitability are critical indicators of positive price rally. This possibly shows that the bearish run in the market is deeper and beyond the market sentiments and indicators. Top banks in the market have been posting impressive results over time but are trading at far below par, which is troubling to both the banks and other market operators. Average non-performing loans in the banking sector has nosedived to 9.3% at the end of first half, thereby raising assets quality of the deposit money banks but analysts said the stock market has failed to reward banks’ chief executives’ performance. In their respective earnings releases for the 9 months in the financial year 2019, analysts see quality assets allocations which supported Tier-I banks impressive performances. However, the big balance sheet lenders stocks’ performance has been largely disappointing, save for Access bank Group whose stock returns positive year to date. Analysts at Meristem Securities in a note stated that market performance depends largely on the economic condition. It further stressed that earnings release would mean less to the market if economic pulse is weak. Mr. Jide Famodun, a finance expert with LSintelligence said: “If you look at recent stock market report, you would notice significant number of Nigerians don’t go near investment in stocks. This is partly due to poor financial education or literacy and inability of market to absorb good news into pricing among other issues”. “You know, banks are outperforming the economy, and market knows how to make adjustment when macroeconomic condition is strapped, Famodun added. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, Tier I banks combined gross earnings for the 9 months in financial year 2019 hit about N2.162 trillion. The elevated earnings represents a 2% increase when compare to about N2.125 trillion made in the comparable period in 2018. Meanwhile, from the beginning of the year to date, the top banks share prices have been slashed, except for Access Bank Plc, the only stock in the money that has maintained a rally.

Profit after tax however expanded by 44.23% from N62.911 billion to N90.739 billion in the period under review. However, analysts said that the weak macroeconomic condition in the country dims investors’ sentiment. Therefore, bears have overstayed in the stock market in the year with unintended consequences of the government policies. In the Tier 2 class, smaller size banks have exhibited mixed results. While some have returned positive, others have had their share priced depreciated. We hope to see market rebounds on the back of projected improvement in the economic growth down the year, analysts said.
