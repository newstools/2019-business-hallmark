Former Chelsea and Manchester United manager, Jose Mourinho has been appointed new coach of Tottenham, succeeding Mauricio Pochettino who was sacked on Tuesday. Mourinho, 56, who has been out of coaching job since he was sacked by United in December 2018 has signed a contract until the end of the 2022-23 season. “The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me,” Mourinho said upon his appointment. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy praised the Portuguese as one of the most successful managers in football. “In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football,” he said. “He (Mourinho) has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. “He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.” Mourinho still lives in London and won three Premier League titles and one FA Cup in two spells at Chelsea, while he won the Europa League and Carabao Cup with Manchester United. Tottenham reached the Champions League final last season under Pochettino but lost to Liverpool in Madrid. The Argentine, who was appointed in May 2014, failed to win a trophy in his time in charge of the north London club with Spurs’ last silverware being the League Cup in 2008.
