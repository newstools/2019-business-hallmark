President-General of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Chief John Nnia Nwodo has complained about the death of reading culture among young people in Nigeria.
He made this known on Thursday at the public presentation of “Riding the Storms with God in my sails; the autobiography of Rear Admiral Alison Madueke.”
Speaking at the event, Nwodo said, “Scholarship is something that is lacking in this country. When we were growing up we were forced to read novels. That is no longer the case. Yong people today don’t want to read books.
“When I was young, I knew all about Kwame Nkrumah before he was deposed. I read about John F Kennedy when he was fighting for the downtrodden in America. We knew history. Today, history is something that is no longer being discussed.”
Nwodo praised the author Alison Madueke for his efforts. He said “It is a serious goldmine for him to put his experience in a book. I beg you to read this book so we can have intellectual discourse with his experience.”
