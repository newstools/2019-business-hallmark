Tottenham Hotspur have sacked manager Mauricio Pochettino after five years in charge of the Premier League club. This comes following Spurs disappointing start to the current campaign where they sit 14th in the Premier League. Former Chelsea and Manchester United boss, Jose Mourinho is believed to be a strong contender to replace the Argentine  at the club. “We were extremely reluctant to make this change. It is not a decision the board has taken lightly, nor in haste,” said Spurs chairman Daniel Levy. “Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing. “It falls on the board to make the difficult decisions – this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff – but we do so in the club’s best interests.” Pochettino was appointed in May 2014 and led the club to the Champions League final last season, where they lost to Liverpool in Madrid. Tottenham said in a statement that they would provide an update on new coaching staff “in due course”. Pochettino also guided Tottenham to the League Cup final in his first full season while two third-placed finishes sandwiched a runners-up spot in the Premier League in 2017. He also lead the club to fourth in the league last season.
