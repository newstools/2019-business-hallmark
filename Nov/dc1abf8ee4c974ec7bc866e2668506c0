Former Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), Dr. Ernest Nduekwe will be leaving the board of Access Bank as non-executive member at the end of his current tenure.
The bank in a release sent to the Nigerian Stock Exchange on Tuesday, revealed that Nduekwe has decided not to seek re-election into Access Bankâ€™s board at the end of his current tenure on March 31, 2020.
He said his decision to step down in 2020 is to enable him focus on some other assignments.
Nduekwe is the current chairman of the board of MTN Nigeria, which was listed on the Nigerian equity market earlier in the year.
Access Bank noted that it was already shopping for a suitable replacement for the former NCC Executive Secretary.
