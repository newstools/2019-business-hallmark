By YUSUF MOHAMMED The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar has promised to reverse the economic situation of the country if elected as president. The former Vice President made this known earlier today, at his campaign rally at Tafawa Balewa Square in Lagos. It was a carnival-like atmosphere at the venue of the rally as Nigerians from all walks of life made it there to support the Wazirin Adamawa. Despite the fact that it was a work day, people trooped out in numbers. Speaking to his teeming supporters at the event, he said he would keep to his promises. Atiku said, “When I promise I do not fail like the APC. I promise to create jobs and I will do it. Now we have the highest unemployment rate in the world. Insecurity has spread from the North East to the North West and North Central. The economy is in a bad shape. Nigeria is now the capital of poverty in the world. People are hungrier than ever. “If elected, I will reverse all that. I will provide jobs.  I will make sure there is a level playing field for all Nigerians to succeed. All Nigerians are equal irrespective of your ethnic affiliation. I will respect our institutions. I will protect the judiciary. I will restructure Nigeria that is a promise. “When Buhari came to Lagos, there were no single trailers and tankers on the Apapa road. But the trailers and tankers are back again. They simply don’t care about ordinary Nigerians.” This is Abubakar’s fifth attempt. It should be noted that on three occasions he did not win his party’s primary. It may be now or never for him.
