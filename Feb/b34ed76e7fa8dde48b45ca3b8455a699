By OBINNA EZUGWU Security operatives shielded President Muhammadu Buhari during an outbreak of violence at the presidential rally of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun state on Monday afternoon. Trouble started after Buhari raised the hand of Dapo Abiodun, the ruling party’s governorship candidate in the state. Immediately, the president raised Abiodun’s hand, some aggrieved persons threw objects towards his direction, and that of the party’s National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomohle, forcing security operatives to form a ring around Buhari. As the crowd trouble continued, Governor Ibikunle Amosun, who is supporting Adekunle Akinlade of the APM to succeed him, had to intervene and appeal to the crowd to respect the presence of President Buhari. Many in the crowd were not appeased and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo had to be called to give a speech, leading to the return of calm at the venue of the rally. © 2019, Hallmarknews.
