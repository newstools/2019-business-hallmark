Nigeria’s leading airline, Air Peace, has emerged Business Hallmark Newspaper’s Company of the Year, 2019. The honour to the airline is part of the Newspaper’s concept of People of the Year, an annual event organised to celebrate outstanding individuals and corporate organisations who have affected the Nigerian economy in productive ways in their various fields in the course of the year. In a letter to Chief Allen Onyema, Air Peace CEO, signed by Chairman, Business Hallmark Advisory Board, Prof. George Obiozor and Member of its Editorial Board, Akogun Tola Adeniyi, the newspaper said the choice of the airline was in “recognition of the groundbreaking feats achieved by the airline in the year under review.” According to the Board, “Air Peace has despite all odds, become the market leader and fastest growing private airline in the African continent. “Our Editorial Board was particularly impressed by your investments in infrastructure and standardisation of services benchmarked against global best practices. Air Peace has continued to set operational milestones and invest in social philanthropy. “We also note with admiration, your recent show of patriotism and corporate responsibility by airlifting stranded Nigerian victims of the recent xenophobic attacks in South Africa. “Your leadership role in setting the standard in the aviation industry has earned the respect and admiration of many, including this newspaper. We are therefore, pleased to select Air Peace for this well-deserved honour.” Some previous recipients of the award include His Excellency, Olusegun Mimiko, the immediate past governor of Ondo State; Emir Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, Emir of Kano and Mr. Godwin Emefiele, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, among others. The award ceremony, according to the board, will take place at an elaborate dinner scheduled to take place on Sunday, November 10, 2019.
