Dangote Tomatoes, a subsidiary of Dangote Group, has established a N3 billion worth Green House Nursery in Kano, designed to process about 350 million tons of hybrid tomato seedlings Managing-Director of the Farm, Mr. Abdulkarim Lawal Kaita who disclosed this on Friday, noted that the Nursery would facilitate increased production of high quality seedlings which the company plans to give out to farmers. He said the company’s new investment in production of fresh and processed tomatoes was capable of stopping the over $350 million the Federal Government was spending annually on the importation of processed tomatoes. “The management of the Dangote Tomatoes Processing Limited which is a subsidiary of Dangote Farms is excited to reveal the tremendous effort that we are making to ensure that Nigeria becomes self-sufficient in tomato production,” he said. “The planting medium you are looking at is called PAT MOOSE which has the capacity of producing 350 million seedling per season that can be used to plant an estimated 12,000 hectares of tomato farm. “We are glad to disclose that we are the first to bring this new technology into the country and this is going to fast track the yield of our tomato farmers tremendously. “The project is being executed under the CBN Tomato Anchor-Borrowers Programme. The CBN will be paying for the seedling that we are cultivating, and it will be distributed to farmers. “The PAT MOOSE process you are seeing takes three weeks, after which it goes to the next stage, and the whole process of growing the tomato takes just three months,” he explained.
