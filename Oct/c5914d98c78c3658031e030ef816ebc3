A lion which escaped from Kano Zoological Gardens is still roaming around the zoo premises after resisting three shots of tranquilisers. The police are said to be on alert, while the zoo authorities have ordered for advanced formula of tranquilisers from Abuja. “At least three darts of tranquilisers were shot directly at the lion but did not fall to its sedative effects. He is still dizzying around the zoo,” an official who preferred anonymity told Daily Nigerian. “We are still waiting for advanced tranquilisers from Abuja to sedate it and take it back to its enclosure. There are fears that the animal is now sober, and may kill other animals with less fortified enclosures in the zoo.” The management of Kano Zoological Gardens had on Sunday morning announced the capture of the lion but later said they only sighted and tranquilise it. The lion had escaped when zookeepers were trying to put it back to its cage. The lion had eaten two goats and one ostrich last night.
