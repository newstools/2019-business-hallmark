The Nigerian capital market is once again shaping for a negative this year with 64 days left before it comes to an end. Curiously, the bearish market has persisted, leaving the major index prostate at the negative corner of -16 per cent as at Friday, October 25, 2019. The All Share Index (ASI) which opened on January 3, 2019 at 30, 771,32 points has slid to 26,348.73 basis points. The same trend should naturally cause a plunge in the market capitalization but for the listing of the giant telecom company’s including MTN Nigeria and Airtel Nigeria which bloated number of shares. This week the equities market lost 0.15 per cent from Monday to Friday 25, 2019 while the index eased by 0.03 per cent from Thursday 24, 2019 to Friday. N20billion however, slipped through the hands of investors as the market capitalization plunged N12.846 trillion to N12.826 trillion in one week.
