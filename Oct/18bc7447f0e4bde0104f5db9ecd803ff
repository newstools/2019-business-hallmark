The Federal Government who is represented by The Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, has commenced dialogue with Labour Unions again in Abuja on Wednesday as time runs out on a deadline issued by the unions for the payment of the thirty thousand naira minimum wage.
A press statement signed by the Director public relations unit of the Ministry of Labour, stated that the meeting was part of the federal government efforts to prevent the industrial action which the workers have planned to embark upon by mid October.
The communique notes that both The leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Trade Union Congress and the Joint National Public Service Negotiating Council are participating in the latest meeting with The minister Of Labour.
Labour leaders had issued a joint communique on October the seventh, warning that they can not guarantee industrial harmony by October the sixteenth, if the Federal Government fail to reconvene a meeting of the committee on consequential adjustments.
