The Presidency has addressed what it called “internet based gossip” and “un-informed media commentary” about President Muhammadu Buhari pursuing a third term ambition, assuring that the president intends to serve his full second elected term in office, ending 2023 and will not go beyond that. The Presidency which stated this in a statement by Mallam Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to President Buhari on Media and Publicity, said there is no circumstance under which Buhari will seek a third term. “The Presidency wishes to correct internet-based gossip and un-informed media commentary regarding presidential term limits, given credence by so-called support groups, staging street demonstrations asking President Buhari to do a third term,” the statement read. “There are no circumstances – nor set of circumstances – under which President Buhari may seek to amend the Constitution regarding the two-term term limit on holding office as President. “President Buhari intends to serve his full second elected term in office, ending 2023 – and then there shall be a general election in which he will not be a candidate. “There is not even the faintest possibility that this will change. It is important to note that there was a past attempt to change the Constitution to allow for the-then incumbent president to stand for a third term. That attempt was wrong, unconstitutional – and rightly rebuffed. “No such attempt will happen under this President. President Buhari is a democrat. He respects the Constitution. Any activity aimed at altering the two-term limit will not succeed and shall never have his time nor support.”
