The presidency has commended the Nigeria Police Force for the discovery of a child-theft racket in Kano State and fake correctional centers in Kaduna and Katsina states, urging them to sustain these good efforts across the country. A statement on Saturday by senior special adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on media and publicity, Garba Shehu, said the president noted that such arrests is in line with his commitment to human rights and dignity of the citizens regardless of their age, religion and ethnicity. “President Buhari will not support criminality under any guise, including the abduction of children and selling them off illegally,” he said. “On torture chambers, in this day and age, no responsible democratic government would tolerate the existence of the torture chambers and physical abuses of inmates in the name of rehabilitation of the victims. “The President, therefore, lauds the efforts of the police in exposing these human rights abuses by individuals and criminal groups, and is optimistic that these efforts will be sustained to check illegal activities of this nature. “The President appeals to members of the general public to remain vigilant and assist security agencies in crime prevention and control by reporting the existence of criminal activities around their communities. “The sharing of human intelligence is everybody’s responsibility in order to make our society safe and this government is ever committed to supporting the police to be more effective in the performance of its duties through proper funding and motivation of its personnel.”
