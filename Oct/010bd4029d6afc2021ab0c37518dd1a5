Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) officials have bursted another two illegal rehabilitation centres in Zaria, Kaduna State. The facilities discovered are Limanchi Iya and Marmara Rehabilitation Centres. During the operation, the security operatives rescued 11 people who were in chains, including an 11-year-old boy. This comes only days after 147 victims were rescued from similar centre in the state, which was the second of such discovery in a month, the first being the discovery of more than 300 people in one of such centres on September 27. About a week ago, similar centre was also discovered in Daura, Katsina State, the home town of President Muhammadu Buhari. The NSCDC Deputy Commandant in Kaduna, Aloysius Nnegha, informed reporters that three people died in one of the centres while in custody, adding that many of the victims suffer from acute malnutrition as a result of the dehumanised condition they were subjected to. According to Nnegha, the two illegal rehabilitation centres were raided following credible intelligence information received on the operations of such illegal rehabilitation centres in Zaria. He also revealed that five operators of the centre were arrested during the operation. Following the operation, the Deputy Governor of Kaduna State, Mrs Hadiza Balarabe, visited the NSCDC office in the state where the victims and the suspects were taken into custody.
