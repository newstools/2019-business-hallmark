On Sunday, 27 October 2019 will mark the birthday anniversary of Nigerian Heroine late Dr Stella Ameyo Adadevoh who died from the Ebola Virus Disease on 19 August 2014. She would have turned 63. You are cordially invited to join friends and colleagues of late Dr Adadevoh, led by Nigeria’s Guild of Medical Directors and the Centre for Impact Advocacy , in a commemorative Thanksgiving Service & Candlelight Procession to honour the Life & Legacy of a True Patriot, whose love for humanity and sacrifice for Nigeria saved possibly hundreds, thousands, and millions of lives from a national and international calamity. Venue : First Baptist Church, Port Harcourt Crescent, off Ahmadu Bello Way, off Gimbiya Street, Area 11, Garki, Abuja. Date: Sunday, 27 October 2019. Time: 7 – 9am There will also be a brief statement read and presented to the media to accentuate the call by thousands of Nigerians who have signed on to a petition sent to the Presidency & National Assembly calling for Nigeria to immortalise and confer a National Honours award on late Dr Adadevoh (over 5 years after her death), in accordance with the National Honours Act of 1964. In July 2014, late Dr Adadevoh faced personal risk, repeated threats, and high diplomatic pressure when she quarantined Nigeria’s first Ebola patient, a Liberian-American diplomat who was to attend an international conference in Calabar, from leaving the hospital she worked in Lagos. Late Dr Adadevoh knew the risks of the looming epidemic if she allowed the spread of the killer disease brought by the diplomat, who knowingly arrived Nigeria from Liberia with the virus in him, through the airports that we Nigerians and foreigners use. Any of us or our loved ones could have become a victim. Late Dr Adadevoh died in the line of duty to save all Nigerians. She paid the Ultimate Price with her life when she took her conscious selfless decision. “For the Greater Public Good” May The Labour of Our Heroes Past Never Be In Vain.
