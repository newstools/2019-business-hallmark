Ebonyi State governor, Engr. Dave Umahi has threatened legal action against Ebonyi Indigenes in the Diaspora and its spokesperson, Paschal Oluchukwu over allegations that he was planning to cede the state’s land to herdsmen for grazing reserve. The governor in a letter yesterday, signed by the Special Assistant on Media, Francis Nwaze, gave the group seven days to retract the allegation and apologise to him or face him in court. He said the allegations from the group published in some national dailies which was credited to Paschal Oluchukwu was prejudiced and targeted at pitting the people of the state against him and his government. “We would’ve ignored you hoping that you are bereft of fact, but because your glaring prejudice for the government and the good people of Ebonyi State informed your action and for posterity sake, we deem it necessary to respond to your callous and baseless assertion to save the general public from being misinformed,” he said. “Such write-up is not just geared towards casting aspersions on the government’s matchless commitments to good governance, but a conscious attempt to pit us against our people whose collective will as enshrined in the constitution, we swore to protect. “Therefore we are giving you and your group an ultimatum of seven days from Friday, October 25, 2019 to write a full page retraction and apologies of that ill-conceived write-up against the Ebonyi State Government in four national dailies, of which if the above is not adhered to, the Ebonyi State Government will take legal actions against you and your group.”
