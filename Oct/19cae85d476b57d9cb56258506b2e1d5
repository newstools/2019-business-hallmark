The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has clarified that total remittances of Nigerians living abroad to the country was $2.6 billion and not $26 billion as quoted in some quarters. The apex bank’s Director, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Isaac Okoroafor, who made the clarification in response to suggestions by experts that the said $26 billion remittances had not impacted positively on the economy, queried the sources of the data being referenced by critics. Okoroafor dismissed the representations as fraught with inaccuracies, alleging that some people appeared to have misrepresented the transactions that constituted diaspora remittances. According to him, the data, purported to be from the World Bank had also been queried by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBN, as it did not reflect the actual amount of inflows from Nigerians living abroad. “We are looking for the so called $26 billion diaspora cash because such cash will impact positively on our reserve,” Nairametrics quoted him as saying. “Understanding the methodology through which the data was sourced could provide an insight into why critics’ diaspora figures might be off the target.”
