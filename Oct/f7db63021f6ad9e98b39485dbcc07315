President Muhammadu Buhari has extended sympathy to the victims of Wednesday’s fire incident that gutted large sections of Ochanja Market, Upper Iweka, Onitsha in Anambra State, killing a number of people, including a woman with her infant child, and destroying properties worth billions of naira. The fire was triggered by a fallen petrol tanker and quickly spread to many parts of the market and burnt from several hours. The president in a statement on Thursday, described the incident as very unfortunate and called on the Ministry of Transport, the Federal Road Safety Commission and other stakeholders to urgently address the issue of safety standards in Nigeria, with a view to stemming the frequency of these tragedies. “The fire incident in Onitsha yesterday is sad and regrettable. I am profoundly touched by the sight of the charred remains of an innocent mother and her child, who are victims of this tragedy,” he said. “I extend my sympathies to all the victims of the explosion, whose houses, shops and other property were destroyed. ”I am calling for urgent action on the part of those concerned to stem these frequent fatal disasters on public roads. Safety precautions and routine maintenance, often taken for granted by vehicle owners, must be enforced. “I call on the Ministry of Transport, the Federal Road Safety Commission and other stakeholders to urgently address the issue of safety standards in Nigeria, with a view to stemming the frequency of these tragedies. May the souls of the dead rest in peace Amen.”
