Another “rehabilitation” centre where at least 300 men were chained has been uncovered in President Muhammadu Buhari’s home town of Daura in Katsina state. This comes weeks after a similar centre was discovered in Kaduna State where detainees confessed to being tortured and sodomised. The Katsina police command which announced the discovery said the victims, men and boys, were rescued from the building, some of whom are children as young as ten. The state’s commissioner of police, Sanusi Buba, who briefed reporters at the centre on Monday, said investigation revealed that the place had been in existence for at least 40 years. He said some children who fled the centre had raised the alarm, leading to a police raid. Buba said there were six rooms in the facility and each of the rooms accommodated over 40 inmates who were dehumanised.
